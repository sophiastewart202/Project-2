margarida-44311, Not Bad,I dont get all the terrible reviews for this movie. Especially because lots of people talk incredible bad of the special effects. Its not Oscar worthy but is not terrible. Its quite good for such type of movie.It lacks some quality on the script but which shark movie doesnt?Theres some other little mistakes but overall is watchable. If you are a fan of this genre o recommend you check it out this one.Ignore the below 4 scores. Its unfair for those who work in this project.,5.0,1
joemay-2, What are all the bad reviews about is it a woke thing,I cannot believe anyone could give this film less than a 6 I gave it an 8 because I thought it was well acted great filming and an exciting story cmon man whats with all the negativity.,8.0,2
nebk, Great White=Jaws Lite,Great White is not the worst way to spend 90 minutes but it does have issues. In the film seaplane tour operators Charlie and Kaz with their cook Benny take out a wealthy couple Joji and Michelle to Impervious Reef. There they find a victim of a shark attack and head back. On the way back they see an overturned boat go to check it out and their plane sinks. They end up in a raft and get stalked by a a couple of great white sharks which are hunting together.There is some tension in the film and the characters dont feel like cheap cardboard cutouts. All of them were fleshed out just enough that the viewer actually cares about what happens to them. The CGI is not great though and this was clearly done on a tight budget. The filmmakers tried to keep the sharks in the darkness and shadows as much as possible and this helps. There are however a few shark scenes that look very poor and this is a problem together with the ludicrous action in the final act as it becomes very unrealistic. Overall the first 30 minutes where the characters are introduced are good the second act has some suspense but the action in the final third of the film is both unbelievable and predictable at times.Overall this wasnt great given the story line and the budget constraints but was watchable. The acting is mostly decent. The film is not realistic especially in the final third but overall it is better than many shark themed thriller horrors. There are some cool shots and suspenseful moments but it could have been much better if the story was better developed.,4.0,3
kuarinofu, Bare-bones killer shark film,Great White is as basic of a killer shark film as possible. Everyday people surviving a pack of ordinary sharks not super-enhanced not vengeful nothing like the Deep Blue Sea or Jaws IV or Meg whatever.My guess is that they were aiming at a more grounded approach and it worked ok until a certain point. I think that real sharks probably wouldnt jump out of the water and intercept you mid-air in a bloody fashion but this kinda takes away the interest from the film. They provide a bare minimum of information about the characters but this is still a killer shark film and you expect something different from the very basic and tired concept.My biggest problem with it was that up until 50! Minutes into the film nothing really happens they just wrap up the set-up. There is also a very awkward racial or ethnic conflict which I did not understand at all it just felt super forced.Its not spectacular its not gory and fun its not original in any way so while I can say that it was a film I cant think of a reason for anyone to watch it.,4.0,4
Horror_Flick_Fanatic," Terrible story, dialogue, and CGI",Terrible story dialogue and CGI. The film has a predictable outcome. But I did like the cinematic wide shots and the overhead birdseye view shots with the sea plane that were done for the first act. Even in SDR the seascapes were impressive. I can only imagine how much nicer it would have looked in HDR. The rest of the camera work not so much. I didnt like the rapid closeup edits for the rest of the film.,4.0,5
NickyDee07938, A decent effort,Whilst the shark survival sub genre has plenty of contributors its probably fair to say that many if not most are really let down by either sub standard vfx or by really non committal performances. The few that stand out including the Reef The Shallows and Open Water do so because they dont skimp on those two very important components. As far as stories go its very hard to offer much in the way of differentiation. By its very nature the sub genre puts people mainly young adults admittedly at the mercy of the oceans top predatory fish which through over reliance on the biggest and most recogniseable as opposed to the most voracious or scheming becomes a little predictable and trite at times. Great White for me sits firmly in the middle of all these shark movies. Its a predictable story with a predictable setup and outcome. Like many horror movies do it invites through its simplicity audiences to predict who will die when based on stereotypical characters and character traits. That said Great White is entertaining enough blending good performance with live shark footage and enough below water above water cinematography to induce suspense. What lets it down rather badly are the few occasions where the VFX sharks fall into the Sharknado realm of shoddy and ineffectual. And thats a pity as with The Shallows level of CGI this could quite easily have avoided the one major pitfall of films in this sub genre - its too dangerous to get real up close footage to convince. So if you have to fake it - dont appear to be faking it. KONTIKI is your reference if you need to see VFX sharks done seamlessly. Anyway this is certainly not a bad film its entertaining and passable as an entry alongside the films already mentioned. Those who have slammed it unashamedly really are doing it a disservice and frankly their critiques or opinions are little more than the chum that minor characters in this type of film become.,6.0,6
Novelwolf, Nice Shark movie!,Much better than the ratings suggest. Its on par with many shark movies out there and this one keeps the tension going throughout and the CGI is ok as well. Better than those horrible syfy shark tv shows.,9.0,7
mbnn," Nice, but could be so much better",First of all I love the film locations drone footage and a lot of things but the way the shark looks like wow.... Its just bad and especially when you get to see it attacking the airplane really really bad 😞the CGI in this movie is unfortunately terrible apart from that its ok.,5.0,8
phobicsq, Typical movie for the genre,The film is meh when it comes to these types of films. Characters are lame and stereotypical but is that a bad thing with these films? No I dont think so but maybe a little more time could be made to build them up a bit.The shark looks bad very bad. Its amazing that the shark in Jaws looks better and that was in the 70s! One of the biggest issues I have with films today is the use of bad cgi and using camcorders for movies. This one has really bad cgi of the shark.There are better shark films that have come out since Jaws and this is not it. If you have low expectations as I did you will probably still be disappointed.,4.0,9
rotini-52586, Liked it !,Thought it was a great Shark Movie . Special effects were decent. Everyone stop your complaining. Geezzzz. Great camera work. Definitely worth a watch !,7.0,10
ops-52535, its raft fever...,At least well 2/3s of the movie its grumpy men and voulnerable women not as old as me though but quarelling just like theyve always done in castaway movies since the birth of cinematology.Its a trip to the gbr area of australia a paradise turns into hell due to a great white dork of a shark sinking their main transportation vehicle and and do the spagat move into the saafety of a rubber dongirolliing the perpendicular waltz rythm of the great pacific ocean. Some small attacks occurs accompanied with a terribly loud sound and musical effects... and thats it. Will they survive?? I shall not reveal anything...i am modestly speaking extremely disapointed by the poor ingenouity by the makers and i wont mention all the breakwaters and sandbottom and shifting sky that the editor has had to work with the obvioiously moored rubber dingy is pretty bad obscured and my compulsive answer to everyone wanting to see a good shark film just forget this one. The script is written in the sand at the nearby beach and of course they are pregnant with a wowsharknado concept is actually far better thinks the grumpy old man even though i dont like them either. This is just to draw a good slump of pocketmoney outta your drawers.,3.0,11
seventhriotontheship, Jaws 57,Many have tried to replicate the success of Steven Spielbergs Jaws and have not yet succeeded. This film too often puts the viewer on a buffer as with a bad Internet and does not help at all to understand what is happening. The creators had an ocean of opportunities and they missed them. Two things worry me: what the sharks have done that they are forced to shoot in this and how you and I will survive this film.,3.0,12
hossamahmed-30148, Below average,When u come to watch a typical shark movie  you definetly do not expect to see an oscar withy movie however this movies dove below the already set average standard of a typical shark movie. Horrible CGI disatrous actors weak dialouge expected story and the list goes on. As a shark lover i immediately downloaded the movie but left utterly disappointed at the end.,1.0,13
divealanya, Total junk movie,Bad CGI and rubbish story. Really!!!The female lead drowns and then is brought back to life underwater by another female blowing into her mouth. The female lead miraculously comes back to life and fights the shark again without taking a breath of air. Zzzzz.,1.0,14
twinmom-10035, Waste of time,I am very impressed how a mouth to mouth underwater makes it possible for the two people to live and continue to hold their breath long enough to kill the shark. OMG!,2.0,15
paul_haakonsen, A very exciting and thrilling shark movie...,"Finally a shark movie that is well-worth diving into if you dont mind swimming with great white sharks.I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Great White"" from writer Michael Boughen and director Martin Wilson with no expectations. I was dreading that it was going to be just another run-of-the-mill shark movie you know the ones that come a dime a dozen. But still Ive always enjoyed shark movies ever since watching ""Jaws"" as a child. So of course I sat down to watch ""Great White"".I have to say that the movies cover/poster definitely was helping to win me over and make me have an interest in watching the movie.Right well on to it. ""Great White"" is a movie that you should treat yourself to watching especially if you enjoy shark movies. Because this 2021 movie is a movie that is driven by a good story well-rounded characters excitement and also a sense of despair from the marooned people adrift. So that was a major accomplishment on director Martin Wilsons behalf.The storyline is as interesting as it is exciting. Sure it is a rather generic storyline if you look at it objectively. I mean you have a shark that accidentally causes five people to become marooned at sea with hundreds of miles to the shoreline as it causes their airplane to sink - gee now where have we seen that before? Duh dum duh dum dum dum dum dum.... get it? But at the same time it is also a storyline that is well-written as it managed to snatch you up and bring you along right there in the raft alongside the marooned five. So writer Michael Boughen definitely made things work.There is a good amount of excitement and thrills in the movie as there should be in any good shark movie. And it worked so nicely in this movie especially because there was such a good balance between the hopelessness of being marooned so far out at sea and the feel of being stalked by a great white knowing it is there in the water but rarely see it come to the surface. I most certainly enjoyed that aspect of ""Great White"".Something else that made the movie work out so well was the impressive character gallery. Sure the movie have only five people in it essentially but these characters are so well-rounded and nicely fleshed out given personalities quirks traits etc. Which made for a very lively movie and you get sucked in right away taking an instant liking to some character and a dislike to another. That was really nice work from writer Michael Boughen. And also a big thumbs up to the cast in the movie. They had casted some really talented actors and actresses for this movie with the likes of Katrina Bowden (playing Kaz) Aaron Jakubenko (playing Charlie) Te Kohe Tuhaka (playing Benny) Tim Kano (playing Joji) and Kimie Tsukakoshi (playing Michelle). Great cast choices and great individual performances by the cast in this movie. And it should be said that the cast definitely made this movie more than watchable.The sharks in the movie were definitely good and felt very real especially since it was a combination of real footage and a prop. And the prop looked really realistic which added so much to the movie. The only downside here was the sound that they added to the sharks sort of a growling thing going on. That was just idiotic. Sure I get it for terms of thrills and entertainment for the movie. But no it just dumbs it down. Sharks are silent predators keep it realistic and keep them soundless. But it was a minor annoyance in the movie which didnt really impact the overall enjoyment of the movie. It was just a stupid little thing that sat like a thorn in the side of me.If you are only going to watch a single shark movie this year make it ""Great White"" because this movie is so well-worth taking the time and effort to sit down and watch. I was more than genuinely entertained by what this movie offered and it is one that I can warmly recommend.My rating of ""Great White"" lands on a seven out of ten stars. This is one of those instances when it is a shark movie done right.",7.0,16
gsyfrafjrp, Waste of time and money!,Totally waste of time and money worst movie to start the summer with.,1.0,17
ryanlion-38514, All Dialogue No Shark,I think I looked at the screen like twice for 10 seconds. This was terribly boring. I couldnt even pay attention or look away from my phone. Rarely do you get to see the shark. The acting was beyond wretched. The worst part is this is coming from someone who loves any shark movies and anything to do with water really. Skip this Snoozefest! I wish I did. Reviews didnt lie here.,2.0,18
kaefab, far fetch and the usual stranded with shark movie,Yes the movie is far fetch some effects are pretty awful looking too shark cgi of course.There is some gore.A struggling tour guide gets 2 customers (rich Asians) and take off on is plane.The reach an island where the asian women wants to spread her uncle remains is last dying wish. But they find a mangled body from a shark attack they argue they look around to find the boat the the women he was with.... when they find it she is dead and the shark attacks the plane sinking it... yeah you read that right.This movie is far fetch now they argue and try to survive on a life boat you know the rest.Boring and predictable and nothing new pass on this one.,3.0,19

benjamin-ensor, Why bother making this?,The EXACT plot has been done so many times before - hell even the characters (maybe actors?) are the same. 5 friends caught out with no contact no rescue - shark circling getting picked off one by one... blah blah.Seems pointless to make this and probably puts people off tourism in Australia. 😂,2.0,21
PennywiseFA," Good popcorn fun, don't expect any realism here",Five people on a rescue mission in shark infested waters what could go wrong? Listen dont expect awesome CGI here the plot is half baked and I couldnt give two squirts of squirrel pee less about the characters but the film packs some nice thrills and overall I was entertained. This isnt trying to be a great movie but just one for the shark horror fans - and lets face it guys weve had just 1 fantastic sharkfilm. Ever. Until the next one comes if it ever does movies like these are enough to still the hunger.,6.0,22
JoelChamp85, What A Waste,I love shark films but I dont know who to blame - the writer or the producers who greenlit this. The story construction is utter disappointment. I couldnt have cared less about the characters it was just wasted screen time. There was one moment the film could have redeemed itself when the chick swam out to get the paddle but nothing happened that could have been a powerful moment instead it was just more bad screenwriting. This whole production was a wasted opportunity.,4.0,23
agnethagillbanks20, What's with the low rating!!!,Okay so first I am a big fan of shark movies. Anything to do with sharks gators and all thatIm there. This film was better than I expected cos I read the reviews and almost skipped it but I am glad I did not. The reviews are so wrong. I have seen worse moviesdull movies that have got higher ratings than this and this movie does not deserve the low ratings. It was interesting right from the start I like that there at least gave some background about the two mains unlike alot of the other similar ones that just get straight to the sharks. All in all it was a very good movie especially if you like these types of movies.,8.0,24
imcaufieldholt, Even the shark was bored,"Avoid ""Great White""! It is just boring. The characters just bicker 90% of the time I think even the shark was bored as it only turned up every now and then before going off to probably watch paint dry or something. In fact it probably just ate people to stop then whining at each other as that is what seems to pass as ""character development"".",1.0,25
lukemurray-40846, Standard shark film,Ill bullet point instead of writing a story.Typical stupid decision making.Shark attacks a plane but doesnt manage to destroy an inflatable life raft.Predictable outcome.Asian chick looked beat up by the end blond girl looked as though shed just come out of the salon.Pre event story pointless.Asian guy annoying obvious he wasnt going to make it.,3.0,26
pjkaustin, Great white load of crap,What a load of rubbish acting was bad story line was bad the sharks were  bad. Unbelievable and so unrealistic. Please dont waste your time or your money. I unfortunately just bought the dvd forv7 quid and Im sticking it straight into my get rid of pile.,2.0,27

nogodnomasters," What about ""it""?","Luke doesnt make it through the opening scene. We then jump to Charley (Aaron Jakubenko) and Kaz (Katrina Bowden) who own a charter sea plane company. They take a couple to an island along with odd man out Benny (Te Kohe Tuhaka) who is slightly dark skinned so we know he will be first to go. Kaz is pregnant so she must be the final girl by ""B"" movie code. The plane has an issue (it sinks) and we end up with five people in a rubber raft who somehow keep falling out.Katrina Bowden did well against flying piranhas so a Great White shouldnt be too much of an issue. This was a cliche shark film. Nothing new.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",3.0,29
Lythas_85, terrible,The plot per se was stupid..come on.. you see a dead guy on the sand and suddenly you feel responsible about his lost and probably dead girlfriend that you end up endangering your own girlfriend who just happens to be pregnant with your child? No no no.Make it that you were planning a get away with her and then the sharks appeared or something.. it doesnt have to be that creative but come on dont make unrealistic reasons for characters to risk themselves for no reason.,2.0,30
irlmchan, Crap just crap,"Tourists charter a sea plane to visit a secluded unoccupied island. The charter is crewed by the pilot his wife and the cook/gopher. The purpose was to return the cremated ashes of a Japanese WWII soldier whos comrades died on this island. The plane is stuffed with suitcases and food for what should be a quick trip. The island is not suited for sightseeing or comfort so why bring the wife and the cook? I know more bait for the sharks who hold grudges and can scream under water.Thats the whole plot. The rest I leave to your imagination. Dont try too hard. Well help me understand how/why they brought a 10 man inflatable dingy along. This was a tiny ass plane and they had more supplies than USS Minnow.I was slightly interested in the ""possible"" plot regarding the females passengers grandfathers ashes. But it was just a stupid connection that leads the group into this secluded island.",1.0,31
omendata, Not bad for a low budget shark movie - Shark effects are actually quite good!,"I also cannot fathom some reviewers either as one of the other reviewers also has stated. I do agree it is ""Not Bad"" even though I suspect margarida-44311 is a shill with only 4 reviews under her belt - The shark effects are actually quite surprisingly pretty passable for a low budget shark movie; with the exception of a bit of dodgy CGI when it attacks the plane it is pulled off quite adequately !Acting is decent for the main part and the photography beach shots and locations are quite lush and some nice drone shots and some nasty gore shots of half eaten bodies all add a professional touch.Unfortunately the story is a bit lacking and the same old cliches and a similar ending stolen from The Shallows make it wholly very unoriginal and to be honest unlike great shark films like The Reef or Open Water what it majorly lacks is any tension or that palpable sense of fear and dread that those other superb films brought to the table and that is what mainly sinks this one for me!I still give it a fair 4/10 as it will make a Friday nights viewing with some sherberts and popcorn but it wont be an epic film evening!",4.0,32
ant36au, Doesn't deserve the bad reviews,Great White really doesnt deserve the bad reviews its received here from people who have completely forgotten what movies are here for to entertain us and in my opinion Great White delivers its a draw you in and keep you interested movie with stunning scenery and good acting from most of the cast with a good storyline I thoroughly enjoyed it does have a couple of ridiculous scenarios but what shark movie doesnt those scenarios are easily forgiven given then the type of movie this is.Give it a watch you wont be sorry.,7.0,33

neil-60137, Great White is awful,New worst movie Ive ever seen! Not only does it not have a plot but you actually want the actors to die right from the start.

Draysan-Jennings, 47 Meters Down??,This film is advertised as if its from the executive producers of the 47 Meters Down series. I went through every producer credited in this film and none of them are affiliated with the films. After reading some of the reviews I was expecting this movie to be a total flop. To be honest I didnt think it was that bad. Ya some of the acting wasnt the greatest and the movie was tacky at times but it doesnt deserve a 1 star rating. Not a film Id watch again but I wouldnt say it was a waste of time. 5 stars.,5.0,36
whitemanfromtowne, Starts stupid and gets worse.,A dumbass aussie pilot decides to play search and rescue with his pregnant girlfriend one crew member and a couple who charted a plane to scatter a family members ashes off rhe coast.

paul-ayres-60784, Some very tense moments.,Another shark tale.. But much better than most. Actually I really enjoy scary shark movies ever since I saw Jaws in the cinema in the 70s. However most of them are laughable. Not this one. Extremely scary and in my opinion it is just as good as the popular flicks like Adrift.I dont understand why people have given this such a low rating. What more can you expect from a movie about a group of people stranded in the sea being hunted by great white sharks? Ive read reviews claiming that the acting is below par but I dont agree. Perhaps Tim Kanos performance was a little bland but not bad enough to drag the movie down a notch. I thought the characters very believable. Kimie Tsukakoshi is totally gorgeous along with Katrina Bowden so no complaints there. The cinematography was breathtaking the sharks very scary and the tension certainly had me on the edge of my seat.Just one criticism; in one scene the shark got himself stuck which is unrealistic because sharks have to keep moving or they die. The water needs to pass through their gils or they drown. Im not going into any more details as I dont want to add spoilers.Well worth a watch I would recommend it. 8/10 from me..,8.0,41
greenhouse3505, Worth a look,Its funny that over the last twelve months movies that would never have been given the green light have had a chance.This is one of those movies.Very low budget but worth a look. Even if its for no other reason than its not another zombie movie. Im over the horror/thriller genre being 80% the same movie just being shot from different angles.This is no award winning masterpiece. But at least its got a little something. Would be nice to see what they couldve done with an actually decent budget.,6.0,42

vengeance20, A Shark Version Of Black Water: Abyss,Had a feeling this film was going to be bad but still decided to give it a watch anyway.The film follows a group of 5 who become stranded in the sea & find themselves floating on a raft while trying to survive Great White Shark attacks.I found the film to be boring for the most part while there were some decent shark shots a lot of them looked really fake looking (Poor GCI) & made even Jaws: The Revenge seem more realistic! The characters were alright aside from one which really annoyed the crap out of me! The film however was short at 1 hour & 21 minutes but felt longer due to it mostly being the group moaning & talking to each other while floating endlessly.But my main hate towards this film is the sexism. All the Male characters die & all the females live (how original) once again its typical in the 2020s that men cant be heros & save the day cause women apparently dont need men (who are treated as useless in films like this) to save them from danger how typical! How EmPowErInG! How Wo0Ke! Seriously? Why do films have to be like this? Cant good films be made anymore? Apparently not in 2021 or the 2020s for that matter...!Overall terrible film! 1/10.,1.0,46

He sounds like & has the charisma of a librarian talking through a sock & a thick one at that I barely got half of what he was saying & the embarrassing youre a genius kid dialogue was cringe. How Freddy is where he is surely is a testament to the ridiculousness of Hollywood or most films of today. PS - I like librarians.Famke Janssen when I realised thats who it was appears to have had an argument with herself & taken it out on her face. My advice as someone whos had a little nip tuck Ms Janssen is to leave it a little longer before you agree to filming & or get a lawyer versed in medical malpractice.As to the movie I went & put the kettle on.,2.0,54

alexcook-47914, Lazy writing and wasted talent,The dialogue is awful and stale which was enough to put me off. I rarely turn a film off half way but after the supposedly complicated machine that meant FH had to go into the bank turned out seemingly to require about 2 button presses I realised just how weak the entire thing is. It stinks of lazy writing and I cant stand a lazilly concocted screenplay. Some great actors all of whom are wasted on this film. With such bland dialogue even the greatest of actors wouldnt be able to pump life into it. Its just not good... at all. Dont waste your time.

Go_For_The_Jugular, Boring and lacks logic,So a handful of randoms and an English kid theyve never met break into the worlds most secure vault...after 1 day planning?!English kid gets an unknown text message and just walks off to meet the person...then agrees to rob a bank with a group of people he knows absolutely nothing about?!When the vault fills with water just as it gets to the top the English kids face was clearly visible on the security camera and was viewed by at least 3 people. Yet he more or less just walks off scot-free with nobody looking for him and he isnt on the run at all...in fact hes already planning his next robbery!Its just an unrealistic joke...more like an episode of Hustle than a movie.And it was really slow throughout.,3.0,61

Neptune165, From good doctor to bad engineer,When will they stop revolving the same type movies? Theres The bank job the Italian job oceans 11 12 & 13 den of thieves inside man heist and more that are basically the same movies with different actors. Just like other movies theyve been recycled with new actors and changed only slightly. Compared to if youve seen one zombie movie youve seen em all or one vampire movie etc. funny planning such a high level heist yet they went with the short ladder. Hollywood always amaze me with their actions. So the bad good guy convinces the good good guy to work for him using the lovely daughter. Then one of the people that work for the bad good guy turns out to be the bad bad guy. Where do I remember that?,4.0,67

daisukereds, Very good! But..,"Tense and entertaining. Very well filmed cast acted edited sound design locations visuals etc. Its a very good package for a heist movie. It doesnt really do anything mind-blowing or memorable but I have no complaints at all which is rare. It feels VERY realistic which sometimes is not fun (when youve seen Mission Impossible 4.. you get a taste for the fantastic and grounded). If you havent seen it and want to pass the time with a well crafted product Id say ""go for it""....Now..Normally I qualify movies as a whole. But I tend to put emphasis on the beginning (Marriage Story being a fine example). If Im immediately turned off is no good but also how easily and smoothly Im introduced to this new world. I tend to be easily dissuaded because of everything Ive already watched in my lifetime. And then there is the ending (like the anime Code Geass s02) which is the most important part of it all. If the story ends and you feel hollow disappointed or let down.. then the time you spent watching feels even heavier a sense of wasted of time.This movie failed me in one of these regards just a bit. That plus the averageness of the script in comparison to others lowers what would be a high score for me. And this was a choice.. I cant agree to it but it isnt my film. Could have been better.",6.0,69
kenzibit, The World Cup Blend makes it feel like a true story 👌🏾,Beautiful and simple movie to get you tensed and excited. I really enjoyed watching this movie a lot basically cuz it was unpredictable and fun. Acting and dialogues were on point with a wonderful idea of blending it with the 2010 World Cup which for some time made me feel the movie was based on actual events.... Such capture from a movie to the audience is every directors goal and makes this movie a remarkable thing to watch. I highly recommend this if you are into heist movies 👌🏾,9.0,70

Nothing to do with the heist movies of the sixties with so much charm.

You even dont care about the characters; you only may wish they succeed. They are not facing their fate their doom. It is agreeable though but I begin to get tired of those films.

Because only dealing with a flooded vault which seems they knew leads to the fountain above which would also be a way out.

SnoopyStyle, fun little caper,In 2008 Walter Moreland (Liam Cunningham) leads a team salvaging a wreck when the Spanish police confiscates the treasure. Unbeknownst to the authorities the treasure is more than what it appears to be. Its a road map to a greater treasure and Moreland needs to steal it back. The big problem is that the government has placed it in an unbreachable vault in the Bank of Spain. In order to solve the problem Moreland hires genius engineering college student Thom Laybrick (Freddie Highmore) who is tired of being recruited by big oil. They have an opportunity during the 2010 World Cup.This is a fun little caper. Its not that complicated. Liam Cunningham is always great. The two problems are Freddie Highmore and the vault. Freddie is always going to look like a kid and I cant see him as a romantic lead. Astrid Bergès-Frisbey may as well pat him on the head. He is probably never going to heat it up. Hes going to be an adorable puppy even on his death bed. The second is the vault construction. I dont really see how its set up. Its essentially the gold idol in Indiana Jones. In Indy the premise doesnt need explaining because its such a small part of it and it is what it is. In this movie the scale construct is central to the story and so it needs to work. Couldnt they place more counterweight which they do in the emergency situation anyways? Couldnt they just do that earlier? Im not sure if the story is mechanically sound. Overall this movie is a good escapist fare although two hours may be unnecessarily long.,6.0,88
htavasoglu, Worst heist movie ever,Ordinary dialogues mediocre acting no tension no thrill no fun no humor no interesting plot.

Im giving it four stars for the effort they put into it. But it doesnt really deserve more than a three star review.,4.0,93
abisio, A heist movie worth your time,"Robbing Banco de Espana has been already made on a NETFLIX series and while the challenges are similar the development is quite faster here (less than to hours) some good suspense moments.Walther owns a wreck recovery company whose latest recovered load was sized by the Spanish government and stored in that bank. He knows within that load there is are pieces that point to a bigger treasure.In order to get that pieces back he lures Thom (Freddie Highmore a little static but still charismatic) a young nerd but very smart engineer still trying to save the world and more interested in adventures than money.There are some other English speaking characters involved; a love interest (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey as Lorraine quite good) a former special units (Sam Riley) and an MI6 shady operative (played by Famke Janssen).On the Spanish side we the always excellent Jose Coronado (as the bank security chief ) and Luis Tosar as the get anything man. Considering how good they are and that is an Spanish production; they probable deserved more important roles (specially Tosar); but still they get a decent screen time and their brief moments.The script is adjusted to root for the thieves; so they have to be the ""GOOD GUYS"" of course.The first part of the movie where information is being collected requires some suspension of disbelief but still works. The third act when the heist start is very well executed and both sides match their intelligence and mistakes.The end is well and open joke but satisfying.In brief is well crafter heist movie; with some original elements and able to keep your interest for almost two hours. Considering other recent movies are far less entertaining; this one is highly recommended.",9.0,94
jacob_leighh," Zero effort, 'Way Down' on inspiration.",This is a extremely by the numbers safe heist film. That is fine i didnt go into it wanting to see a genre subverting heavy hitter. I would have simply taken competent and failing that something fun. I watched this in April 2021 and my standards have hit bedrock and started digging. Still I was disappointed.The movie had one key issue. Casting... The main character Thom played by Freddie Highmore is so awful. I didnt like him Good Doctor and sadly I think he borrows a lot of traits from his character in that show. I hate him in this. He has zero 0! chemistry with the rest of the cast.He is the guy you get if you want a super awkward stilted performance of a genius who cant hold a conversation. The problem is they had hm being the sudo hollywood star that saves the day and gets the girl. You cant have it both ways with this lack laster script and a actor with such little charisma.The rest of the cast arent anything to phone home about either. Not because I feel they acted badly but because of chemistry. Again... They dont play off each other they look uncomfortable to be in eachothers company. They could have subbed their co-stars for brick walls.Verdict:Avoid its a good looking competent movie with alright passing. Unfortunately it is beyond average in all other regards.I would highly recommend watching something like Flawless if you havent. Otherwise just a rewatch any of the oceans films. Even 8... If you want something a little lighter and silly go with now you see me,3.0,95

It still had a feel of those early Freddie Highmore films he made as a child actor such as Women Talking Dirty (1999) Finding Neverland (2004) Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) August Rush (2007) and The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008) etc that I love so much.Its not an Oscar winner but its a worthwhile watch (unless you are one of those people who just cant get their head above a 1 type 1 style of film).,7.0,102

itsbobr, Good Heist movie,Walter (Liam Cunningham) and his Salvage crew found a treasure chest from a Spanish Galleon long submerged but the Spanish government denies Walter the treasure. Walter hires Thom (Freddie Highmore) a student engineer to figure out a way to get the treasure from the underground Vault of Bank of Spain which is heavily guarded and impossible to break into. This cant be good.Once Walter and his crew draw up the plans a wrinkle occurs and that is Gustavo (Jose Coronado) the Chief of Security for the Bank of Spain and he knows the Bank is at risk during the World Cup Football Game between Spain and the Netherlands. He knows because his cleaning crew job was cancelled but found out there was another cleaning crew on the premises. Oh oh..........Yes this is like a Mission Impossible story. Dont try to memorize everything just go with it. The real problem to be solved is that once the Vault is breached it will lower itself into water and anyone captured in it will drown. Thom needs to find a way to prevent the Vault from going into the water.Here is what they are looking for. Back in the day the Pirate Francis Drake sunk the Spanish ship took the treasure and hid it away marking on 3-coins the exact whereabouts of the treasure. So the 3-Coins are what are needed and they are in the treasure chest Walter took up from the sunken Spanish ship.Notables: Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Lorraine part of Walters crew and helps Thom figure things out; Axel Stein as Klaus Walters computer hacking guy; Luis Tosar as Simon who is someone who can get anything needed; Sam Riley as James Walters hot-headed right-hand man who takes a dislike to Thom; Famke Jansen as Margaret a British Civil Servant who betrays Walter.Toward the end the Vault is breached and the water comes in. You knew that would happen right?This is a good heist movie and gets exciting near the end. You keep asking about a twist. Yes there is one. (7/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: No.Nudity: No.Humor; No.Language: Yes but brief at times and also in some sub-titles.Rating: B.,7.0,105

The movie is so full of tired cliches lazy tropes bad dialogue and plot holes that its basically unwatchable.If someone had just taken the time to correct some of the obvious errors and cut that bloated film down to 90 minutes it could have been great entertainment. But whoever was is charge here didnt care and what we got instead is an uninspired mess that just keeps dragging on.The sad part is that the movie had some cool ideas and a lot of people clearly put a lot of love into it. The actors are doing the best they can special and pracitcal effects are cool and so are props and costumes. But that alone cant change the fact that script and editing are horrible.

mitchellkendrickwhite, Major Spoilers - Everything wrong with this movie,This movie is for those who can turn off your mind and just enjoy things being destroyed. Heres why:1) Every character death was annoying and pointless. For example the first girl to die was betrayed and left in the kitchen. It would have been fine if they left her there to die and maybe it would create some tension in the group. Nope. She comes storming back into the hallway and then dies in front of anyone... without pointing out that the dude betrayed her. Also why didnt anyone shoot the zombies around her? They just watched her die. Example #2: the German dude... finally uses a brain cell and decides to go for the vault. This was obviously the smart move... but he closes his friend in there and dies outside. What was his plan? To lock his friend in and just wait out there with the other zombies? What a moron. Hop in... then pull it in to close it. Example #3 the chick holding the head. Why not set the head on the floor aim at it and walk back into the chopper. Nope. She decides to sacrifice herself. For no reason. Nice. Also why was she carrying it around?2) The daughter is insufferable. Her reasoning for even being in the movie is a joke. She cares soooo much about this random mom that she just has to go back in there for her. False. When the helicopter crashes the chick doesnt look for the mom or care about her at all. She only goes up to her dad. The script just forgets about the mom. I honestly was hoping the daughter would die because she only complicated things and makes bad decisions. Why assume the people are in the Olympus? Why not ask your dad to go with you? Why not bring more than a pistol into the quarantine area? But apparently we should care about her because the main character does.3) Every shot is a headshot. Even the daughter shoots the main zombie in the head twice from 50 yards. The zombies decide to not bit when they are clearly in biting distance. This basically made the movie boring because you knew the main characters werent in any danger until a scene was coming to a close.4) They leave the gate wide open when walking into the quarantined area. This killed me. I guess I should have stopped thinking at this point in the movie.5) If the bad dudes plan was just to get the vile of blood then why not shoot the scout. Take its blood and leave. Tell the group they will get paid and lets go back now. Nope. Betray everyone for no reason (tell them youll kill the helicopter pilot for no reason) and go for a head of the main chick. Cool.6) Why did the zombies keep some people for a few days? No explanation... just need to keep the mom alive so the girl is justified in ruining everything. Actually.. why would the girl even assume she was alive. What a dumb character.7) Robot zombies? What? Why? I assume the Mexico City sequel will explain that the government created the alphas to control the others and use the zombies as weapons. But IDK. Cause it seemed like the government wanted zombie blood which they could have gotten if that was the case. Makes no sense.6/10 is generous. Only points given are for... releasing a movie during covid. At least it made me go to the theater.,6.0,128
tackstactical, Do not waste your time,2 Hours and 28 minutes of your life is what this movie will cost you. Time you can never get back and could be better spent getting an unnecessary 4 finger prostate exam. Nothing about this movie is redeeming the story is about a extremely selfish daughter who gets everyone killed. Rose from the Titanic was a more considerate human and we all know that Jack could have fit on that door. That is the lesson here dont raise selfish children.,1.0,129

aerie124, This movie insults your intelligence - this movie is one giant plothole,Besides being a beat for beat and markedly inferior Aliens rip off. After Scream and Cabin in the Woods which parodied character stupidity in horror movies ZL makes sure that each and every character chooses the absolute worst decision possible.Of all the complaints about length you can excise the execrable daughter and the illegal aliens plot line and you wouldnt even notice. In fact this entire plot line feels like it was tacked on at the last minute as a tribute to his Zachs daughter.How is it that even rank amateurs can get off head shots so easily? Is it really that easy to hit someones head while they are running at you? More than 1/2 the shots in the movie were head shots.How do you get out of a vault from the inside? And even if you dont suffocate wont the immense radiation from the explosion at ground zero kill you near instantly? How can he walk miles and miles in the desert and not die of thirst and somehow find a car? How come he turns into a zombie days to weeks afterwards while everyone else is zombified within minutes?If the entire idea was to get some blood why did they have to do this entire charade about getting the money? There was another team that died at the first gate why didnt they just get the blood from a rando zombie and leave? Why didnt the mole just tie up the queen zombie in the first 20 minutes get blood and leave them to their heist? Even better the government had the king zombie in custody. Why didnt the government just take the blood then? (since Tanaka appears to be working with the military)why why whyZL can produce great visuals. His story telling is awful because he has no clue about pacing or plot. Or even consistency.,1.0,131

It was painful.",3.0,132
pizzadudes, Disappointing,I dont bother with trailers and previews so thought it would be the same zombie world as Dawn but in a different setting and stage of the outbreak. Dawn is great and captures the mood perfectly and has a great cast. This is full of annoying cardboard cutout characters with a stupid plot with some zombies acting more like deranged humans from Mad Max or The Hills Have Eyes. Everything about this felt forced and lacked genuine emotion or tension from the getting the team together scenes to the heartfelt scenes between Scott and Kate (I had to look up their names) to the mission itself (oh theyre there already) and the inevitable finale. Ive no idea why certain people didnt just fly in with a helicopter and get what they really wanted. I just found it all very dull and didnt care at all what happened.,3.0,133
nadiaafreendiba, The worst from Snyder yet,I rated it 2/10 just because of the stunning visuals. Theres nothing original about it. Like several well known zombie movies have been mashed together with a heist movie without retaining any greatness of the source material. The daughter who survivedKate was so annoying. She should be enough for you to dislike this but if not theres more. Wooden actingchoppy camera workincoherent storylineno payoff. I wanted to like this so bad because I love Dawn of the Dead but theres nothing to like here.,2.0,134
dcj2, What happens in Vegas...I didn't really care.,"***Possible mild spoilers ahead ***I had such high hopes for this one. The slow-pacing of the first act promises something more than the typical two-dimensional characters but it never pays off. When the action finally starts its just a sequence of events - this happens then that happens then something else happens. None of the character choices are driven by their backstories they just do things to move things along to the next set piece. The pacing if awful. Just when the action gets up some steam we pause for extended quiet dialog scenes that add nothing to the story. Arguably the two most intiguing characters - the zombie leader and his...girlfriend? Are given no backstory at all. The action pieces are shot well enough but nothing is all that original or memorable. The dialog is cringe worthy in a typical Zack Snyder way. The musical choices try too hard to be clever (Elvis singing ""Were caught is a trap..."" the Cranberries classic song ""Zombie""...) are just too on the nose to be amusing. Overall the movie is waaaay too long. By the time we hit the 2-hour mark (with another half hour to go!) I had given up caring about any of the charavters and just wanted them to drop the nuke already so I could get on with my life. Snyder fanboys will no doubt love it as is evident by all the 9 and 10 star reviews but for the rest of us this one is easily skipped.",5.0,135

lukerlemieux, Let's suck the fun out of a Zombie movie by adding hateful characters and awful plotline.,With the exception of Tig Notaros character I couldnt wait each of them to go.I came in with low expectations as with most Zombie movies. But one does expect a fun campy horror/gore flick. The plotline seemed to have promise...Dave Bautista is recruited to build a team thatll go into the Zombie infested Las Vegas to fetch $200 millions dollars sitting in a casino vault. Sounds like itll be fun to watch.The first problems comes when you see the team that is presented and you immediately hate every single one of them with the exception of Tig. You hope that these folks would bond at some point but they never really do. When an attempt to create some bonds it just falls flat and is not very genuine.The second big problem is the storyline splits off in several incomprehensible arcs which repeatedly breaks the flow of the story. The father reconnecting with his daughter arc is just silly and predictable.The action sequences are pretty good though some are a little over the top but enjoyable to watch. The Zombies themselves have are well done but they get lost in the mishmash of the story arcs. And the ending was pretty good though not great.In conclusion this isnt a bad film I just wished that Zack would have trimmed down some of the subplots and given us more Zombie action.,3.0,137

ctimmons-20908, Lacking Style and Substance,Between Snyder and Bautista I had decent expectations for this movie. After all I really like Snyders Dawn of the Dead. However despite a promising trailer Army of the Dead offers nothing new to the genre and doesnt even offer much excitement in the unnecessary 2.5 hour run. It was made to seem that this was some elite team put together for the heist yet most of the characters seem pretty useless and make annoyingly stupid decisions. Its also amazing how seemingly unprepared they all were for once they got into Vegas. I thought this movie would at least have some stylistic action as it was clearly lacking in substance but most of the action was just cheesy (and not in the good fun way).I wont even get into the plot holes basic logic/physics and other similar issues because I didnt go into this movie with high standards on those factors. But as others have said a lot of things just dont make sense with this movie.The trailer and the opening credits were probably the most entertaining part about this movie. If youre on the fence about watching this save your time.,5.0,139
RavingJinn, Falls way short of its awesome potential,A number of reviewers have already taken shots at the huge plot holes and ridiculous setup of this movie; I share in both their criticism and disappointment. If you happen to care about such lofty things like coherent storytelling or character development Id wait to watch this lazy entry into the zombie genre until youre either drunk or stoned to overlook its many problems.And while Zack may have gotten some kind of personal thrill out of manning every major job in this project the outcome has clearly suffered as a result. What could have been an otherwise outstanding zombie action flick given proper attention to detail and an avoidance of lazy tropes is instead no more than another sparkly yet mediocre piece of cookie-cutter movie confection.The fact that more movie goers arent outraged by the significant and apparently permanent drop in quality/intelligence of most these blockbuster Hollywood productions is what bewilders me. Apparently just shoveling an old retread of a story into a production-line CGI machine is enough to satisfy most of todays audience who blithely flock to praise and subsidize whatever vapid POS comes out. Are super hero action scenes really all were after anymore? Isnt it time to demand more for your entertainment dollar?,6.0,140

mhorg2018, When will people realize Snyder is overrated?,What a waste of time. I thought his Dawn of the Dead filled with plotholes was poorly done. But this-this ridiculous mess. This is the kind of movie where you get a bunch of ten year olds together have them shout out what theyd like to see in a movie write that all down throw the ideas in the air and put them all together and write a screenplay. Lets point out some of the stupidity in this movie:1 - No respect for the military. Who were the people at the beginning? Stockade scrapings? All they did was argue and not pay one bit of attention to what they were doing. Why were they transporting the first zombie? How about a little air cover? Or blocking off the entire highway?2 - Stupid soldiers. Rather than escape by jumping right into THE RUNNING HUMVEE they run into the desert. These are professionals?3 - So the bad guy wants a sample of zombie blood. Couldnt get any while the military was blocking off the entire city of Las Vegas?4 - Dropping parachutists right into the middle of a zombie mob? Really?5 - Ammunition. How much ammo did these people carry? HOW MUCH? They never ran out!6 - Bringing in two inexperienced people on such a dangerous mission? The safe cracker and the unnecessary only there for drama annoying daughter. Really? She should have been the first to get killed off.7 - The nuclear strike. OK city gets blasted off the face of the earth. Why not do that right away say right after they blocked it off? Also why didnt any of the super zombies climb the wall? Smart enough to have sex wear clothing fall in love and use primitive weapons but not smart enough to climb a frakking wall?8 - The super zombies. Sorry a lame idea. Zombies already have the numbers so why the hell do they need to be smart and see the above comment.9 - The safe. So the safe has an escape tunnel? How did they know about it since it seemed it went dark when the one character got locked in.10 - The stupidest part of the entire movie. After the nuclear strike the one character WHO HAS BEEN BITTEN escapes and WALKS through a post nuclear strike. No radiation to kill him? And he ends up on a private jet where he starts to change. So when this plane crashes he wont burn with it?Just an incredibly stupid movie. Face it people Snyder is a freaking hack. WBs put way too much trust in him. Hes done one great movie 300 (probably because Frank Miller was involved) two decent movies Watchmen and Man of Steel (which had a ton of problems as well) one so-so movie BvS: Dawn of Justice which came along way too early. All his fans screamed about Justice League. His four hour cut isnt that different from the released version other than superman in black (ridiculous since hes supposed to be Hope) and that overlong epilogue. The rest of his movies Dawn of the Dead this and especially Sucker Punch (I still want my money back for this) are trash. Hes like a lesser version of Michael Bay. And please stop whining about your other Superhero movies Zack no one cares and theyve seen through you.,1.0,143

max_111, I have canceled my netflix subscription after watching this.,The worst movie of all time. I dont know why netflix make movies anymore. After I care alot I lost all hope in netflix. Now coming towards this movie i was really hyped by all the zombie genre and thought that maybe this will be another Day of the dead. But oh boy i was so wrong. This is the worst movie ever and not to mention they ruined the zombie genre so effectively. Major spoilers ahead:How come the soldiers didnt saw the headlights of coming car before the head on collision. Any sane person specially a tactical trained professional would have spotted the car a mile before.How come the armored military truck worth millions of dollars just simply gave up infront of an old 70s beat up car.Why did the two remaining soldiers didnt got in their humvee and got the hell out of there. Instead they chose to walk in the woods with a zombie hulk chasing them. Wow hats off to the writers of the movie.Why did scott just readily accepted the offer of 50 million and didnt demanded more.Why ( a big why) did the boss remained quiet and didnt gave them safes codes or told them about the booby traps.How were they so sure that the helicopter would still fly and didnt cared much about the weight of the money and the passengers.When the first girl died why she didnt told her boyfriend about the traitor. There was plenty of time for her to spit it out and save many lives.How come no one said anything when they found out that there were many teams before them who just happened to die in the casino and near the safe. Any sane person would had got the hell out of there after learning that secret.Why on earth the bosss man ( with the queens head) went outside the building and not on the roof to the helicopter.Why didnt the team had not one single silencer with them. It would be so easy to just kill the zombie tiger the queen the other alpha zombie in the beginning and get over with it. And that too without alerting anyone. Plus it could had been so easy for them to continue without offering the bait. (which was insane btw)*The worst mercenaries ever* The daughter character was so dumb and annoying. Minus her in the movie and it would be a much better movie.* The list goes on and on and on.A wasted opportunity in my opinion. With this budget they could had made a superb movie.

justjakenit81, 10?! Are you out of your mind,Zack Snyder had some dope visuals in his films but his storytelling and characterization always leaves some to be desired. Problem is this movie isnt even that visually interesting. The credit sequence is the highlight of the movie!! Whats the point of having a movie in Vegas if you do nothing with your setting and reduce it to crumbling soft focus background details. Oh but there is one scene with slot machines!! Literally a one minute scene when they are in a casino the rest they are in dark corridors or piles of rubble. Are we supposed to believe that zombies completely eradicated Vegas and reduced it to rubble. Literally looked like a meteor hit Vegas.My biggest problem are with the characters. There are way too many it reminded me a lot of suicide squad the way they introduced them in this montage. They literally hire one of the team members because he made a YouTube video shooting zombies.. like really.. arent there some more soldiers you know? But seriously who cares who makes it out. And you made a 2.5 hour movie with a story that could have been told in 70min and couldnt figure out how to make us care about any of the characters.I could go on and on. I used to love zombie movies (original Dawn one of my favorite movies.. Zack remake was..) but they have been reduced to nothing more that pointless monster movies that are a shell of what they once were with absolutely nothing to say other than heres some gore!

But first how to do it.1) Dont read any more reviews.2) Watch the movie start counting how many things are wrong with the plot/writing feel some outrage lose count of the goofs stop caring.3) Come back here and read other users reviews especially the ones which enumerate the absurdities in the movie (for example the one titled ""Things we learned from Army of the Dead""). Have a couple of decent laughs. If you had a first laugh keep reading. It gets better since youll find more and more F-ups you hadnt noticed before.

He tries to be funny and you just want to punch him on the face.The vault is protected with traps that seriously reminds you to the beginning of the movie Indiana jones and the lost arc.Theres some weird vampire vibes mixed with zombies.An extremely selfish daughter that puts everyone at risk to safe a woman and at the end of the movie at the scene of the helicopter they dont bother to show us if she even survives.A kind of king of zombies with her queen having a random baby. Wth was that. Seriously.Oh and the guy in the vault somehow surviving the radiation on ground zero and not becoming a zombie for days or whatever took him to cross the desert??...The acting is not very impressive neither but tbh they didnt have much to work with from the start.The script is really terrible. Everything is predictive and boring. This was such a waste of 2.5h...The music... completely random choice that seemed to be added just to fill the lack of everything else.

orangehenryviii, Army of the Disappoint-Dead,Did you know that dead is a synonym for boring?I do love me some zombies and had high hopes for this one like everyone but they began evaporating with the Zombieland clone opening credits and deflated further with every cringe-worthy cover of a classic rock song and apparition of a woefully miscast actor (et tu Notaro?) until after wincing and waiting for the movie to start gaining steam it instead rolled itself backwards off a cliff into a flaming lake of stupid.I dont expect much from a Zack Snyder movie other than breathtaking visuals which is fine. Sucker Punch and Justice League et al delivered the goods but there were no money shots here just some goofy CGI and ho-hum action sequences all dimly lit and shot with a zoom lens cramping the scenes and blurring out the background i.e. The zombie horde (the money shots).Its hard to believe this is the same director who did the great 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake. If only James Gunn had done the script for this one too! The writing is the real nail in the coffin here with a plot so implausible that even an 8 year old would want to poke holes in it.The only thing truly dead here is any hope for the upcoming franchise and also my behind from sitting through this 2 1/2 bore.,3.0,165
sr-w, Dave Bautista deserves better movie scripts,"Everybody dies because Kate tries to save some person who isnt part of the movie.Kate doesnt get the money in the end either. She gets a ""small amount"" to get the kids out of the camp. THE CAMP THAT WAS JUST NUKED?! Did I misunderstand this or what?Kate survives a nuclear blast and seems fine after the chopper went down. And a US Air Force chopper comes to the rescue - wayyy too close to the nuclear blast. Im pretty sure they wouldve died.Anyway. The movie focuses on Scott who tries to get this money for his daughter but that doesnt go well. The money ends up with Van who spends it on a private plane ticket (why?) but he dies... Not from literally walking through the radiation zone hours after a nuclear blast but from being bit by a zombie.Who wrote this? And who decided to fund the script? I have never given a movie a rating this low because I feel bad if I do. People have put in so much work into this project so I dont want to slam it. But come on. This is not a zombie movie. Its a fantasy movie.On the other hand - I have some positive feedback too:1. Dave Bautista. I really like this actor and I loved him in Bushwick. Great and underrated movie. I think Dave is a very underrated actor who deserves much better scripts than Army of the Dead.2. CGI etc. This movie looks great. The zombies are pathetic (a king and a queen with super powers... lame) but special effects and stuff look great.3. The splatter stuff. I loved that.

Golden_Hope, Insane fun,This movie is complete non sense and I loved it so much.It can be hard to find a place when making a comedy that is absurd but isnt just like stupid if that makes sense but this movie finds it.At first I wasnt won over by one of the main plots and didnt understand why it was there I thought the movie should have just been about the main characters trip but it proved me wrong and tied it all together perfectly.The jokes are a mile a minute and yeah sometimes they are duds but it doesnt matter because there will be another one any minute that wont be and will really land.I also think that even though this movie is completely illogical I think it really got its characters. They were fleshed out and thats what made them funny. You knew them after watching it they didnt just say stupid lines for the sake of it you felt like that was actually what them characters were like.I also loved its colours they were just so sweet and candy like. It looks so good and worked really well with the filmI think this movie was great and you should give it a watch.,7.0,171
masonsaul, Gleefully absurd comedy,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is a gleefully absurd comedy thats really fun even if the jokes dont always land. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo are terrific with perfect chemistry. Jamie Dornan is excellent and Damon Wayans Jr. is consistently really funny. Josh Greenbaums direction is really good its well filmed and extremely well paced. The soundtrack is also really good and the music by Christopher Lennertz and Dara Taylor is good.,7.0,172
aaronshowland, I couldn't stop laughing,Barb and Star is so incredibly random that it shouldnt work and yet...it is so incredibly funny. Is there a message somewhere? Yes. Do I want to go party with Barb and Star? Also yes. If you need a nice refreshing laugh this is it. Prepare for fun cameos unnecessary but much loved bouts of singing and a very different tale of friendship.,8.0,173
RoryIrish, Dornan steals it,I knew Jamie was funny in interviews but that doesnt automatically translate to screen. In the first few minutes I wasnt sure. He seemed subdued. I expected a cameo but hes central to the movie and by the time he lets rip with an ode to seagulls or love or something... well goddamit hed won me over. The movie around him is a bit hit and miss though its more hit. While dissimilar in plot I found the movie resembled Zoolander in tone and sheer mentalness. I like Zoolander.,9.0,174
markwoolley-64442," If you loved Bridesmaids, DON'T watch this..",Love the actors hate the movie. It just doesnt work and is not funny. A couple of the visual gags are good but even for a spoof this is poor. Comparisons with Bridesmaids and Austin Powers are way off - this is nowhere near the same league. I paid £12 to watch it which is money I will never get back. So save your cash and if you are intrigued watch it when it is free...,3.0,175
dancehardordie, Overall a really bad movie.,There are a handful of laughs to be had but few and far between. Its entirely absurd which is fine but most of the jokes are misses. Very disappointing.

rthdesantis, New Cult Classic For Sure!,This a movie that can and WILL be watched over and over again! Lines will be quoted by many and I would even bet there will be many who dress up as Star and Barb too! Such a fun witty imaginative and hysterical movie. Its definitely a must see!,10.0,177
rocketwoods, This was actually funny...,I thought Barb & Star was going to miss but... it was actually a hit and was funny as hell lol. I gave it a try based on bridesmaids which was a hit and written by the same characters also. If anyone doesnt like this movie its because they expected a bad comedy. The comedy (which is also PG-13) was wildly different than anything weve seen in a long time. Trust me!,7.0,178

simonb-667-548936, Yawn,I watched this stoned and drunk and it still wasnt funny! Possibly good for young children who have not yet developed a sense of humor but are easily entranced by shiny things. Kristen Wiigs signature brand of quirky humor is fine for an SNL sketch (or the first 20 or so minutes here) but quickly begins to grate and drone and feel entirely one-note.

chrisk0, Silly doesn't mean funny,We have the girls gabble on about an imaginary friend theyd like to have named Trish. They describe her at length. This was meant to be hilarious. A lounge singer has a song about liking boobies. Is the word itself supposed to make it comedy gold? Wiig and Mumolo thought so I guess. Is the extended gabbling about anything that popped into their heads supposed to be funny because its done with a nebraska accent? Again they seemed to think so. A tedious movie. Jamie Dornan pretends to be a comedic actor while having no business being a comedic actor. The whole thing was forgettable after about an hour.,1.0,182

webwizardbe," just a cheap neurotic mess, don't bother watching believe me",Wiig co-wrote this movie so I expected something funny but I ended up watching 2 hysterical women babbling babbling babbling. It was just annoying.The storyline itself was absurd and very weak. It looked like it was written by a child or someone under influence. This movie was all over the place even strange.It opens with an over the top villain in her secret lair with a plan so dont expect a movie about two women in their 40s living out their midlife crisis in a vacation town.This movie was just absurd but not in a good way. My attention drifted away and after 1 hour I didnt even want to know how this movie ended and turned it of.,2.0,187
babilichpavel, The cutest movie of the year!,Today I watched this film and was very delighted. It is a comedy a romantic film a musical an action movie and a fantasy film. Thats all you need on a cold winter evening. This is a very warm kind funny and incredibly colorful film. Wiig and Mamolo are annealing to the fullest! There are also some incredibly bizarre moments in the film (crazy talking crab !!!) that the two women didnt know how to guess. It could be a good candidate for this years Golden Globes especially due to Wiigs double performance if it came out a little earlier or a little later. It is the best comedy released this year so far.,10.0,188
finneypollard, Not funny. Not watchable.,Not at all what it looked like in the trailers. Absurd idiotic disjointed plot not funny at all. Its really cringy that two wealthy middle-aged women would write a film insulting to middle-aged women of limited education and limited means. Kristin Wiig is usually clever and funny. I dont know what happened to her to cause this mess. Utterly unwatchable. This was included in a streaming service I subscribe to so I didnt pay extra for it just wasted precious time before I gave up and moved on a third of the way through.,1.0,189

lotekguy-1, Disappointing attempt at a coming-of-middle-age comedy,As any SNL fan knows from the range of her sketches when Kristen Wiig is on her game she can be hilarious; other characters of hers can be pointlessly or excessively annoying. In this outing she and co-star Annie Mumolo play the eponymous gal pals who seem destined to splurge on a big vacation. They lost their jobs and were ousted from their suburban social circle (a nicely satiric group of tea-sipping Karens Talk Club) on the same day another friend gushes over her recent vacation to the titular Florida destination. And theyre off.Unfortunately their trip coincides with an over-the-top supervillains elaborate revenge plot against that resort town. She is sort of a distaff Dr. Evil whose pasty complexion makes Tilda Swinton look like a sun-baked beach bunny. Thats not pale-shaming; its key to the plot. Such as it is.Remember Romy and Micheles High School Reunion from 1997? Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino were a delight as ditzy innocents with a lifelong bond that synced their minds on a wavelength beyond most peoples comprehension. This one plays as if those characters are back 20+ years later having been drained of all their charm. Barb and Star work and live together chatting incessantly over mostly meaningless minutia that has kept them on their own island of reality. Their characters grow tiresome long before they grow in their story arcs. The result is a tedious experience relieved somewhat by a smattering of truly funny moments. Among those are a few clever songs (one going almost full Bollywood) and surprising mostly uncredited cameos from stars who must have assumed the final script would turn out much better than the working version they were sent.Barb and Star is mediocre fluff. Even so for those who watch heres a bonus tip. During one characters semi-romantic song on the beach watch the shadows on the sand to see how many different times of day were involved in the filming of one sequence. Its something for the unengaged to do.,4.0,193
sxsxndnf, RIP Jason K.,"On the morning November 26th 2019 my parents found their son and my youngest brother dead to his addiction to ""bliss.""To be clear; I didnt want to watch this film. Im glad I did. My brother was an alcoholic and a drug addict for the better part of 13 years starting not long after he graduated high school. He had long a beautiful seasons of sobriety during this time. But most of these years were ruled fraught with relapse jail court broken hearts and cautiously optimistic hope.In his last trip into the land of bliss not long before his death meth had truly taken him to different worlds though I must say here that none of them struck me as anything more than a nightmare.Im not sure that the world Jason sought looked like the one in this movie but I know he first traveled there to escape the pain he felt deep inside. Loss of child hood friends contemplating his own identity as an adopted son (With us from birth mind you) and the battle in his own mind as a baby carried to term by a drug addict herself.Along with my tribute Ill add that Im grateful to have seen a glimpse of what his world might have been like. It was terrible and helpful. This movie is unsettling every step of the way if you love someone who is or was battling an addiction. Youll probably only watch this once or maybe never. But there is no doubting that it was a worthy venture to tell a difficult story that resembles the lives of those trapped by drugs and maybe even more importantly us who live as ghosts in the lives of those we love. Sorry to anyone else who knows this pain.Love you. Miss you. D.",10.0,194
sydnee_man, The worst thing about this movie was the marketing.,I was really excited to watch this film. I love sci-fi and Im a big fan of both actors. I was looking for something fun and quirky but thats not what it is. About 15-20 minutes into the film I had to adjust my expectations. I had to shift my thinking from sci-fi to drama because thats what it really is. *SPOILER*Its a drama about addiction. A lot of people probably didnt realize this because theyve never had to deal with a loved one that has addiction issues. Unfortunately I have and I saw all the signs. I understand why the writer/director wanted to leave it up to interpretation but I think that just led to some confusion - especially for people who dont have any experience with an addiction. I also think theres a bit of mental illness in there as well and that fits because a lot of people with mental illness self medicate with illegal drugs.All of the haziness occurs when people are coming down off their high. During their highs everything is blissful - or so it seems. Thats the only thing that could explain why people would hurt their families - especially their children - so much.I think its a worthwhile movie with great acting. I think people will enjoy this more once they adjust their expectations.,8.0,195
enchanteddaisy, A beautifully enlightening story about drug addiction,"Greg is a drug- addicted man and Isabel is his addiction enchantress.If you follow the symbolism and metaphors starting with the foreshadowing by the Drug Rehab center sign seen out of Gregs office window you can get an enlightening idea of what it is like to be addicted to drugs and to be homeless. To me Isabel is quite literally Addiction itself. As she appears dirtier and her hair more disheveled he is becoming more addicted.This movie was eye-opening for me because Id never before been able to understand that someone being ""blissed out of their mind"" could actually seem better to them than the real world around them. A drug high can seem like a utopia compared to everyday struggles guilt pressure stress and poverty. Escaping to that temporary place is a reprieve and I now better understand the allure and difficulty of breaking addiction. Ive never felt this addiction but I feel like I can have better sympathy and understanding for those who have.",8.0,196

She takes him to that dream world.

julio-42075, Unexpectedly amazing portrayal of addiction,"The trailer is strange and the ""Matrix"" idea that develops at first is misleading but the sequence of events is engaging.At the very end I started to comprehend that it is really a portrayal of the fantasy world created by drugs and addiction and the parallel of what probably drug addicts suffer.The idea that they should inhale a magic crystal to transport to the real world back and forth the ideal conditions of one world the misery of the other and the confusion between their worlds plus the final solution of rehab gives a clue.I don´t think this has anything to do with science fiction.I found the mistery of how the things are presented simply fascinating and the narrative in the style of The Sixtth Sense but with a less obvious resolution is still making my mind go through the plot details to confirm my theories.",10.0,199
frankie-08908, Wrongly Advertised,Those who marketed this movie made a huge mistake. They gave a high expectation of a Syfy type movie. I watched this movie with exactly that in mind and it left me lost and confused. I really believe its because of the lasting impression the marketing left on me.It took me just about past the midway point of the movie I started to realize it wasnt about Syfy at all. Its about drug addiction the mentally disabled and homelessness. The moment I recognized this I had a better impression of the movie. Having a career in LE in a city I experienced many with those difficulties. Its easy to criticize the homeless or dismiss them but if you had a better understanding of the issues theyre having mentally your feelings would change. And I think this movie did a good job putting the viewer inside the mind of an addict/mentally ill person. I only wish those in charge of the marketing would have done a better job.With having a better understanding of the movie the actors did a great job.,5.0,200
neil-43355, Not Sci-Fi,Whatever impression the trailers or your film guide have given you - this movie is not a Sci-Fi movie - its a simple story about how a man can simply drop out of society because of things happening outside his control and the challenges faced by homeless addicts with with mental health issues top acting and a decent story and far better than a lot of the dross that has been unleashed on a disappointed public during the pandemic.,7.0,201

Clue. His daughter is looking for him his son seems angry and asks ""Whats it going to be this time? His shoulder? Leg? His back?"" Clue that went right over our heads.Selma shows up and it starts becoming clear. She represents personifies addiction. He meets her and goes off to bliss but every time he comes back to reality its darker and dirtier. Is it a simulation or stimulation brought on by these weird ""crystals""?Some unnecessary brain machine sequence threw us for a minute but the clues are everywhere screaming the real point.This is a brilliant movie that I wont spoil anymore. Its so well done so subtle but also is quite clearly telling us what happens when you chase or try to keep chasing the euphoria of that first drug-fueled bliss.Im going to watch it again now that I know what its really about.

dtrani, Amazing film! Bad marketing.,The way you react to this film depends on how you view two things: Drugs and Homelessness.The trailer is very misleading as you may accidentally mistaken it for a sci-if thriller. Its not a thriller and can be very disappointing when you go through the film at first. Whoever developed the trailer did not market it well and is very upsetting.But if you sit back and experience it with no expectations the film is actually very good.Our two main talented actors do a really good job of portraying these unique character and really give you a sense of who they are and what they are experiencing.As of the time of this review the film was just recently released and already is having mixed reviews. Its a story inspired by real situations told in a unique and thought-provoking way.Which is why it really depends on your thoughts and views on the real world issues this is based on. It may come across as controversial in some ways but speaks some truth that isnt spoken enough about in the mainstream.The ending was super good and doesnt leave you upset or unsatisfied like some films like to do.Very solid and deserves more credit.Although whoever was in charge of marketing did not do a good job.,8.0,205
goonerchris-161-428318, Makes you think long after watching,I watched this after watching the trailer though the trailer seems to be for another film I was not disappointed. I watched this with the wife on valentines Day thinking it was a bit of a romantic film and we both seemed to actually enjoy it. The film never tells you what its about it makes you use your brain to think and talk about what is happening and what did happen. We both worked out what the underling story was but there are so many questions you think and rethink after the films finished and thats what I love about this film its not easily forgotten but I do want to see it again. When I do I will probably see it from a different view and end up with a different score. Watch it and enjoy the ride which I will be as interesting as mine,8.0,206

To be clear (spoiler) the addiction starts when he snorts the pain meds and his wallet begins to flicker. It was a rabbit hole from there on out. Are there unanswered questions...yeah. Does anyone have all the answers for drug addiction and mental health....nope and thats where the film is set.",8.0,207
rebeccagraywithana, Great film about drug psychosis.,Bliss is profoundly hitting home for me as a family member of loved ones with drug addiction psychosis and schizophrenia. If you are trying to fit it in a matrix-style sci-fi box youve missed the point. Its about the subjective experience of mental illness and the absolute reality split that is experienced by the person while their loved ones desperately try to reach them. Its about the person giving their power away to another person allowing their psychological boundaries to be crossed because that sense of reality was extremely fragile to begin with. Both people can fuel and reaffirm each others psychosis.Ive see my loved ones in drug fuelled co-psychosis. I think that is what this film is portraying. This is a great film. Well done to the writer and cast.,9.0,208

ns26, Wow.....Ingenious!!!,This movie gives a glimpse into the mental realm of an addict that rolls with the highs and lows of hallucinogens opiates stimulants etc. I cant believe all the poor reviews. It makes me think that people cant think outside the box; that they were not able to make an accurate connection between the events in this movie and the altered mental status of a hardcore addict who suffers from cognitive distortion and other mental symptoms caused by excessive drug usage. This movie used symbolism in an ingenious way. If one analyzes this movie one can see the correlation between the specific events and the effects certain drugs have on the mind and body. Those who gave negative reviews are probably interested in a movie that is black and white not gray and abstract like Bliss. Kudos to the writers for such incredible creativity!!,10.0,211
tk-dj, Interesting...,I found this movie to be a really interesting and thought provoking take on what it might be like inside the world and head of the drug addict. As the mother of a grown adult who was for a time teetering on death due to his addiction and totally unreachable because of where he was I wonder if his experience was similar to what this movie portrays. In the few professional reviews I read (none of them favorable) the fact that this movie was based around drug addiction and homelessness never even seemed to enter the equation. Huh??? Anyway I thought it was really good and I enjoyed it for what it was. Great acting by Wilson and Hayek!,7.0,212
tandeki, One gem of a movie!,For me bliss is a pleasant surprise. It tells a compelling and interesting story of a guy whos life goes down the drain in a visually unsusual and stunning way.It is not an action movie and it certainly is not science fiction. It is a drama which tells us so much about the life of people we try not to see on our streets and under bridges. And it makes it clear why it is so hard to reach people who have an addiction. Bliss is street slang for bath salts and bath salts describe over the counter powder drugs which give you halluzinations but also have terrible side effects not only to your brain. The main protagonist played by an excellent Owen Wilson made the wrong decisions. He lost his wife his family his job and is now homeless and a drug addict.This movie is a work of art. Because it uses sounds pictures and an excellent soundtrack to let you experience how an addict experiences his life. Beautifully done and therefore a pleasant surprise for me.,9.0,213

Which word would you prefer? Can you live in a world and be happy because you choose to? Are your problems real? Do you need to change or does the world need to change for you? All of the themes in this movie are classic Science Fiction devises used in literature and seeing a movie not a short story not a novel give me the gut punching thought provoking moment of contemplation was so wonderful.

alex-mott, Stick with it - it's worth it,There are more levels of meaning to this film than may be obvious. With the number of highbrow story elements compressed into 100 mins (causality loops DNA coded missing mass Egyptian mythology and catastrophism) it would have been very easy to overwhelm and confuse the audience with too many ideas - but Boss Level doesnt. The story is well told very well paced and seems to make a point of intentionally evolving from chaotic and complex to calm and clear. Clive Ventors plan is horrific but logical and its eventually revealed that Roy Pulver really only ever had one job from the start. When he devises his final final final FINAL plan despite everything thats happened it makes perfect sense and also provides a valuable message about not giving up - even when you know the situation is completely hopeless.What could have been just a nihilistic Groundhog Day shoot em up turns out to be something far more intelligent and emotionally engaging. Good ending too.,7.0,216
rolytnz, What Did I Just Watch?,"....a freakin awesome movie is what I just watched.Give me some leeway here as this is my first IMDB review. The way I judge a film is primarily is when I finish watching I ask myself ""Was I entertained enough to such that I would pay to see that again?"".While I admit openly that my threshold for entertainment is low this one far exceeded that.I have seen Frank Grillo in a few movies he seems like a bit of a B-Grade Action Movie Guy - boy was I wrong. My opinion has changed greatly such that I shall go seek out other Frank Grillo movies.As the main guy Boss Level he delivered an outstanding performance. His blasé deadpan attitude was very funny - after all he is a guy who was just over it starting each day dying rinse and repeatThere are some real parallels with Groundhog Day on the journey he takes - the ups and down and how he games it to his advantage.Mel Gibson was ok a typical Action Move Antagonist - some of the other quite unique characters maybe be somewhat clichéd but still very funny.There are no Oscars here then again who cares about the Oscars anymore? What I want is entertainment and that is what I got and then some.",9.0,217

Jim_Screechy, Very Good action flick,I going to come clean and say I flat out loved this film. It has a great cast script action direction and of course special effects. Equally important the choreography in the fight scenes is excellent. I never thought I was being hoodwinked or short changed by careful cutting rapid shot changes or careful camera placement.Although it has a pretty good if somewhat simplistic storyline it has been adapted very imaginatively with what is actually quite a lot of forethought planning and development. I felt a little cheated with the ending but on retrospect I couldnt really have asked for too much more... maybe theyre doing a Boss Level II.Normally I expect Frank Grillo to be either a second tier good guy when the likes of some A-lister is unavailable or possibly out of budget or a first rate bad guy a role he tends to somewhat excel in. Here hes the star attraction and with Naomi Watts and Mell Gibson bringing up the rear and its a good combination.Grillo is sharp witty romantic and... well displays a range as an actor that we rarely see him portray and he does a great job. As an action actor there are few who can walk in his shoes both physically and with his on screen presence lets face it he gets a lot of work in this area for a good reason but I wasnt expecting him to be a lead in a role that really demands a lot more of his acting ability and quite frankly Im pleasantly surprised. Not that Im saying he couldnt act before just that well... Ive not seen him in many parts where hes had much more to do than be/look hard and or beat people up.Gibson is Gibson at this stage of his career gritty unhinged and accomplished.Watts is never truly convincing as a scientist/doctor/researcher. The rather alluring slinky dress that functions as a lab coat or some other type of boffin garb was ill thought out but she nevertheless manages to deliver a competent performance whilst adding a sultry appeal that doesnt go unmissed... perhaps the dress isnt such a bad idea after all.The minor cast is for the most part an accomplished line up of add-ins who do a pretty good job in filling in the necessary spaces for villain-hood goonish ineptitude and thuggery. Some are quite enthralling and I loved the way that a multitude of baddies are employed for skulduggery even if it is (given the protagonist and his lack of superpowers) somewhat excessive. Whilst Michelle yeo is largely unused she nevertheless gives the story some credibility.Anyway I wont give away any details on the plot but it is a good film with a pretty solid delivery all round. Im not going to nit-pick on the fine points of the story or temporal mechanics of the notions therein and even though I do like the fact they didnt try and explain away some aspect of science I didnt so much like that a fair amount of meat was left off the bones of the science aspect of the film... not that it mattered much since it wasnt really the focal point of the film... well not really.Anyway go see it. Solid 7.5 out of 10 for me but Ill give it an 8 since it was an unexpected pleasure to watch.,8.0,221
ThomDerd, Yesss that's a fun movie!,Frank Grillo at his best supported by a good cast and a cool script. The one-liners are a highlight in this film as they give away the smart fast-paced story and the swag of Grillo as an action lead actor. The action starts right away; this is not a boring movie by any means. Cant say much about the plot as this might be a spoiler but if you like action/comedy/sci-fi with a big splash of coolness then thats your jam! 9/10 for the fun!,9.0,222
jayson12524, The Best Movie Of The Year I Never Heard Of,Hulu should really do better on promoting this film. It is one of the best thrill rides I have seen in a long time and wouldnt of known about it unless a friend told me! The cast is terrific and the Groundhogs Day sci fi twist makes it a fun roller coaster ride ! Its the Summer movie we have been waiting for years to see !,10.0,223
gatozangado, When low expectations meets great execution.,This movie trailer gives you the impression that you dont need to watch it as youve already seen the good bits. It makes you expect nothing but still look forward to a descent action flick; the good news are that youre wrong the best is yet to come.The first impression as the movie starts is that the movie has its own pace and a great one. Thats the same director of Smoking Aces and you can see a lot of his dynamics playing out perfectly on this movie.The big surprise comes with the main characters arch. The story is good enough but the journey the protagonist has to go through in order to see the next day is a game changer satisfying it pays off.The movie is not perfect and thats all right. We cant expect a film to meet everyones expectations. Those guys did their best and at the end of the day they achieved it.Im one of those people who doesnt get impressed easily I hate CGI and think that most movie makers these days dont have the balls to make characters with unique even flawed attributes that go against the Hollywood stereotype.It aint the best CGI Ive ever seen but I was too busy having fun to judge how well made it was.Id never score a movie based on its budged but instead on how well it all works as a whole within its own limitations. 9/10,10.0,224
theedeer," Good movie, likeable characters and funny. Well done.",Took a concept thats been done before and put their own twist and personality in it. Well done. in my opinion.

danielcereto, Groundhog day meets Crank,This movie is just for fun. Do not take seriously and enjoy the ride. Pure action good acting and acceptable (not great) FXS. Frank Grillo is stillbelievable as an action movie star and Mel Gibson is great as a villain too. So forget twists and great scripts and enjoy the ride just for fun.,7.0,227
DragonFodder185, This is Frank Grillo ...and Frank Grillo has done this!,"WHOA!!! This movie totally knocked my socks off. I was expecting a B maybe even a C level movie but boy was I wrong! BooM... John Wick meets Groundhog Day!The movie starts off with a an assassin trying to kill Frank Grillos character Roy Pulver and never lets up on the action. When it does ease up you have some quirky comedy met with some touching father & son moments. Very interesting that Franks Grillos real son played his on screen son Joe this explains their natural chemistry. Some of my favorite moments are of the swords-woman Guan Yin and every time she kills Frank Grillo says ""This is Guan Yin and Guan Yin has done this!"" So its hilarious and satisfying when Frank Grillos character Roy kills Guan Yin and says ""This is Roy and Roy has done this!"" Such brilliance.I never really appreciated a Frank Grillo until now. I remember watching a Purge movie with him but nothing super memorable came from it but this movie really showcases his talents in the most superb way. I think the guy is in his 50s and hes rocking a perfect in shape body and looks healthier than most 20 year olds. Im left with wanting more of this awesome action star.Oh yeah and the movie also showcases some heavy hitters like Mel Gibson and Naomi Watts who do a great job as well. But the real GEM and STAR of this movie is Frank Grillo. And the movie has a fantastic ending so you will not be disappointed.",10.0,228
Mah_Jam, One of the best movies I've seen this year,I actually enjoyed watching this movie a lot as its full with brilliant acts and moves.

otnememento-2, Non stop action with plot,Fantastic movie. You wont get a single minute of boredom. When action is not happening you cant help thinking what is really going on. Grillo is great here and he finally gets the movie he deserves as a main actor. I give an 8 based not on the quality of the movie but because it really made me have a great time. Way above average action film.,8.0,231
tjasnow, hey this is a good movie!,The trailer actually makes this seem goofier than it actually is. time loop stories are actually difficult to tell. Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow are gold standards but this does a pretty good job - taking you on the same ride as the protagonists as he learns more and more about whats happening and how he can change the outcome. Another surprisingly enjoyable part of the movie is the dialogue. Its very of aware of either itself or the corny cliches of other action movies and Frank Grillo does a good job of delivering the snark. Get comfy on the couch with a few beers and enjoy watching this one.,7.0,232
maidwell-45616, Groundhog Day meets Scott Pilgrim Vs The World,....And just as fun and querky as that mash up suggests!Great performance by the lead actor interesting concept and slick execution throughout.

siderite," Excellent and concise, it is a proper sci-fi story, with some decent action",Do not get deceived by first appearances. Yes its a small movie it stars Frank Grillo who had to act in some pretty shoddy films in order to get ahead and its not something for the Oscars but it is a perfect little film for what it wants to do. The plot is simple: infinite time loop second movie like that Ive seen in two days. But instead of having the hero moan about the boredom of having infinite time which always annoys the hell out of me it starts with people wanting to kill him. All top assassins finding him wherever he runs. And if he dies he starts over if he does not his wife dies then his son then the world ends.If I had to compare it with an existing film I would rather compare it to Hardcore Henry than to other time loop films. Yet that film was an experiment in video game cinematics while this is a decent sci-fi story: a good ole what-if with some action sprinkled for fun. So congratulations to Joe Carnahan and to Frank Grillo because they made one of those gems in the mud that people talk about. And yes Mel Gibson is a secondary character at best but so is Michelle Yeoh and both are perfect for their roles and they clearly have fun with them.Bottom line: watch it you wont be disappointed.P.S. Is Naomi Watts annoying in real life too? I mean all her characters are awful. In this one she admits she didnt know whether her plan would work you know the one where she kills her husband over and over and over again then the world ends.,9.0,237
flakwagen," Man Meets Robot, Ditches Robot for Hot Babe with Gun",Cherry 2k is a low budget one-off adaptation of the Mad Max concept mixed in with futurist technology ideas and a very cool love story. The male star goes on a quest to replace his lost robot sex android. Thats the basic plot.Whats unusual is that this movie succeeds in mixing these elements without screwing up. The Sci-fi perspective doesnt overwhelm the overall plot and vice versa.Very few B grade movies from this time period were watchable much less worth keeping in ones collection. Fortunately Cherry 2000 bucked this trend and deserves a spot on the shelf of any cult classic and/or Sci-fi movie collector.,10.0,238
gridoon," Some dull parts, but still an effortlessly likable movie.","""Cherry 2000"" was a huge commercial failure and its hardly ever mentioned today but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Sure the script is unimaginative and the film has no real vision and the action scenes are strictly routine but the two leads are enormously effortlessly likable. They make a deeply sweet pair. Maybe the film should have concentrated more on their love story and less on the familiar action aspects of the story. And the violence of a couple of scenes seems rather out of place. But even with its weaknesses this movie is fitfully absorbing and very entertaining.",7.0,239
Mulliga, Surprisingly fantastic...a real treat,"Okay ""Cherry 2000"" has finally achieved ""cult film"" status. But unlike many other cult movies it actually deserves the title.There are many things to like about this flick. The nuanced likeable Ben Johnson has a good role that even delivers some tragedy (how often do you get that in a b-movie?). The charismatic Griffith is alternately contemplative and kick-ass. Of course Tim Thomerson as Lester nearly steals the show providing a truly strange ruthless villain.The effects are cheesy sure but they never look fake unlike a lot of the CGI films coming out today. When you see E. Johnsons Ford being dangled over the Hoover Dam that is an ACTUAL car not some stupid digital effect.The movie does lay its message on thick but considering the obvious budget constraints they were working with thats a perfectly excuseable flaw. The satire is at times hilarious (watch for Larry Fishburnes turn as a lawyer with Morpheus-esque reflecting sunglasses and the final exit of the villain is truly visually ironic). I bought this on DVD (having never seen it on TV) and really liked it...maybe you will too.",8.0,240
tiomkin, I thought high camp died in the '60's,until I saw this film. Its absolutely hilarious.  And Ben Johnson was just a treat.  Melanie was never so pouty and sexy but that Mustang she drove steals the show.  A really underrated film with lots of very wicked things to say. This relates to Mad Max about like 007 related to spies or (Chief) Inspector Clousseau related to detectives. Well its not in the same class but it takes a stab at camping the Road Warrior.,7.0,241
pguzzo, Absolutely wild movie. A Classic must see.,When I first saw this movie I was hooked. I watched it many times and I still find new things. It grows on you. Really good cast and storyline. Watch it! Pamely Gidley is just superduper and the settings are like the Wild Wild West!,8.0,242
theemaster, What makes cherry special?,"Imagination.. Heart..Very few sci-fis have this much heart and this much story packed into a beautiful movie.. So how can I describe Cherry?Cherry starts out like every good story and builds up to it by first establishing the universe.. a post-apocalyptic world (or sum such) where recycling is important new fashions are in play and sex robots are possible and people (at least from the characters point of view) have to have contracts to date/copulateCherry then shows us one of the first *real* female action heros (basically Tomb Raiders Laura Croft v1.0) and some great desert and action sequences that are widely unpredictable and done wellAll the while this stories carries on with credibility and imagination Cherry 2000 is one of the most successful B movie sci-fis ever accomplished its these kinds of movies that give me hope to see more.. I personally love and still love a lot of 80s movies and 80s style we have yet to recapture in our lets make it all more real setting.. Im not saying that gems arent still made today they are; theyve just been rarer to find as of late..Since Cherry is a special vein of movies all its own its important we list em - Mad Max - The Road Warrior (this one is very special) - Dead-End Drive In What I can say about Cherry after multiple viewing maybe 5-7 now in my lifetime since I first caught in cinemax or one of the movie channels one night.. is thats its very very special.. That the story is so good that it can play catch-up or compliment movies like ""A.I."" another one of Kubricks unfigured out masterpieces..Normally I would say this movie is 7/10 but Im upping my vote to 8/10 for now do to shear appreciation of this movie vs. some of the crap we have been getting these past 2 decades.. (note of course sci-fi had a great few years from about 1997 to 2001)On my last viewing this time I noticed again how good Basil Poledouris score compliments the movie.. (and there is some noticeable re-use of Conan in there but all composers even the great John Williams seem to re-use in part some of their stuff)",8.0,243
FiendishDramaturgy, Vastly under-rated obscure sci-fi.,"This little-known under-rated obscure little film packs a lot of entertainment value.A 1987 production directed by Steve De Jarnatt and starring Melanie Griffith David Andrews and Pamela Gidley ""Cherry 2000"" goes highly unnoticed and unsung in the sci/fi field. However; I cannot say why as this movie is extremely well written and extraordinarily entertaining.When Sam Treadwells robotic companion breaks down he goes in search of an exact duplicate in which to install her memory chip and continue his life. He hires Edith ""E"" Johnson (Griffith) as a tracker to find her and together they begin their journey into ""The Zone;"" a danger-filled jungle of a city in which Treadwell finds the ideal replacement for his Cherry model 2000 love.It is not just a science fiction classic but it is a tremendous love story and a marvelous work of writing. The acting left a bit to be desired but this little-known work of art is definitely more than worth seeing.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",7.0,244
gregc, A fun movie that never takes itself too seriously,A lightweight love story underpins a fun story with a range of eccentric characters in a world that has lost it.

dhousman-349-732822, Cherry 2000 Location,Cherry 2000 was interesting for many reasons not least for the unusual location for part of it. The name Sky Ranch was used and this represents a place that actually exists. The headquarters of the bad guys which was called Sky Ranch in the film was actually what remained of Ash Meadows Sky Ranch a permanently closed Nevada brothel. Until it closed in 1973 or 1974 Ash Meadows was considered one of the best of Nevadas legal brothels. The closest town was Death Valley Junction which is in California. A dirt and gravel road was all there was to connect to Ash Meadows and a billboard marked the turn advertising free coffee.The brothel itself featured a small motel a pool (seen in the movie) a 9-hole golf course and an air strip which might still appear on civilian aviation charts.Some time after the brothel closed the State of Nevada made it a landmark of some sort and I believe it takes special permission to enter.If not for Cherry 2000 I would never have been able to see this place. Thousands of people have seen the movie Cherry 2000 without knowing that they were seeing an historic place.,8.0,246
gr8t92play_1, Enjoyable,I have loved this movie since it first appeared Melanie Griffith is tough and sassy. I liked Pamela Gidley in the beginning of the movie but she seemed not to be a factor in the end. I liked the part at the dam the most if you ever come to Las Vegas you must go to the Hoover Dam on the Az. side and you can look down the tunnel where they lowered the car. Good film should be a cult classic. I liked to say that when I first saw this film I never knew it would stick in my head like it did. I have two sons and told them of this film over and over since we moved here in Las Vegas. I would show them places where the movie was filmed and now that I own it on DVD they go and see just what I was telling them about. I think that is really COOL.,8.0,247
MrcnBty, Pretty decent time waster...,"Ive always been a really hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fan so of course I did really enjoy Cherry 2000. David Andrews and Melanie Griffith had great chemistry together and this pre-Data android: Cherry 2000 (albeit an intelligent sex toy) gave the plot an amusing and very human twist. Basically when Sam Treadwells (Andrews) robotic playmate/best/only female friend dies he desperately needs a replacement. An exact replacement. He braves the wilds out in the desert to reclaim his lost love. How will he find his dream girl? (Spoiler!) By finding another one! Sam hires a Tracker Edith Johnson also known as ""E."". E is a sexy capable hard woman (Griffith). Although E is the antithesis of everything Sam held dear he finds love eventually....just not in the arms he expected. A classic love story with a futuristic twist this isnt exactly fodder for an academy award however the acting was decent the story was well written and overall the experience stays with you. (These are pretty much the things I look out for when Im rating a movie). Since most of the story is set a world very reminiscent of Mad Max and Waterworld fans of the post-apocalyptic type of fantasy should really enjoy this movie. Heck give it a chance. Id rate it as being about 2 points above Waterworld on a scale of 1-10. The effects were remarkably good for its time. Not much (if anything actually....) was fake or CGed. Even though the story is set in 2007 most people I know are able to make the leap to suspend their disbelief and enjoy this ride. Give this one a try if you like sci-fi!Fans of less subtle movies true dramas regular romances will probably dislike this movie. Either they wont get the subtle jabs at society and the human condition or they wont enjoy the setting. Overly analytical philosophical types probably wont enjoy this film either. It does take a long time to get the main point across.",7.0,248
andressolf, IMDb's rating is too low for this movie. It's more like a 7+,This movie is one I ALMOST skipped entirely because in my mind 5.3 is an abysmal score to give ANY movie. I once saw Talledega Nights with a girl I was very much in love with-it was a time when NO good movies were being released and Snakes on a Plane was out at the same time so those were our choices. Let me tell you that Talledega Nights was the worse movie I ever paid for and had to suffer through. Terrible film. But the reason why I bring it up is that a piece of junk movie like that was still well received by a few airheads and they thought it was funny- the girl i liked being one of the few airheads who liked it. That movie scores higher on IMDb than this movie does and that is a down right shame because I would give TN a 1 out of 10 or 4 out of 10 if I were being more fair but I would give THIS move Cherry 2000 a 7 out of 10 at least. What does this all prove? That movie ratings can sometimes be misleading. That someone can tell you a movie is awful and you would find that same movie great and vice versa. So what this ultimately means then is that you have to watch this movie yourself and come to your own conclusion. As for myself I was pleasantly surprised. I had low expectations and found this entertaining enough and it moved right along smoothly. The movie has a good pace.,9.0,249
secragt, Very Strange Movie...Somehow Quite Watchable,Curious futuristic sci-fi offering has a sexy performance from Griffith and likable work by Thomerson plus an intriguing high concept premise. It doesnt totally come off but theres definitely some interesting stuff going on amidst the flaws. Scifi movies about the future often dont date well and this one is no different but its not without its charms.Some action sequences are jarring and out of place; perhaps they should have concentrated more on romancing the two leads who have nice chemistry. This is grade-c stuff but somehow whenever I see it on the tube I pause for a while and check it out. Despite flopping when released this movie has taken on a formidable cult status since. Might be worth a look especially if you enjoy post-apocalyptic stories like ROAD WARRIOR or WATERWORLD.,6.0,250
SMS_Emden, Gritty Underrated Post Apocalyptic Romp,"In an age of CG everything Cherry 2000 shines even more now than it did in the eighties. Great story gritty landscape wonderful cast of characters and a cave full of toaster ovens. Dont let the age of this flick put you off if you havent seen it and have even a passing interest in post apocalyptic and/or sci-fi flicks.The special effects are live action which really stand out if you havent watched an older movie without CG in awhile. The setting is thoroughly appropriate for the story and genre. Is any movie truly ""worth"" a 10 out of 10? They will all have flaws but in my book if at the end of the flick you are thoroughly entertained and transported to another time or place and have a smile on your face then the crew succeeded in their mission in movie-making.",10.0,251
gsanders1-1, great action movie,This is an interesting movieI heard about it from the word on the soundtrack. The movie is known more its soundtrack then the movie it self.the soundtrack has the record for the highest price paid for a compact disc it sold on ebay a couple of years ago for $2000.00 for the compact discso when I heard that I had to see the movie. its in the future where Melanie Griffith is a action type bounty hunter and this guy has an android lover which is his wife that dies and he has to do find another one like it.but she is kind of out of production.he can get a modern one but he wants the same one so he hires Melanie Griffith to go in to this war zone and track it downthere is only one place where he can get another.in the end he goes for the real thing and not the android.there is action and great music.it will entertainI recommend if you like sci-fi and action movies.,5.0,252
Son_of_Mansfield," I love B movie casting, even when it's wrong.",Melanie Griffith may look like a redhead but she talks and behaves like a blonde. She would have been much more suited to play the robot as she is not tough enough to be the fiery redhead. Griffith does manage to be attractive enough to steer Andrews from his toys. David Andrews is convincing as the uptight executive who needs a real woman. Ben Johnson plays the charming cowboy as good as always. Tim Tomerson steals the movie as the 80s desert wasteland villain. Brion James Lawrence Fishburne and Jennifer Balgobin have roles that are too small for their talent. The movie is an amusing little trifle that deserves its cult status and should please fans of the broken civilization genre of the 80s.,4.0,253
axlrhodes, A marketing migraine.,"Filmed in 1985 but shelved and not released on VHS until 1987 perhaps the most telling thing about Cherry 2000 is that its producer Edward R. Pressman reportedly confessed that the films distributors Orion Pictures were ""stumped"" by the films confusion of genres which led to the long delay in its initial release.Seeing it for the first time its easy to see why it was such a marketing headache. For starters it isnt really any good however in being a crazy mish-mash of bits of everything and having the good sense to never take itself too seriously its hard to feel annoyed with it.The film is set in the year 2020. Mankind has progressed to the extent that its now possible to own a fully functional supermodel stay at home girlfriend (Cherry) who knows exactly how to treat her man – we never see male model counterparts. In the first scene our lead character Sam Tredwell ( David Andrews) has a soapy after dinner mishap with his own Cherry 2000 doll which kick-starts the plot of him having to travel the wastelands of Zone 7′ to find another one. Yes folks its as ridiculous as it sounds. Co-starring with Andrews is a jaunty looking Melanie Griffith who seems to be playing a female Rambo running and gunning her way through her scenes. Surprisingly some of the stunt work locations and set pieces are genuinely quite stunning which makes it all the more a shame that the end result is such an elaborate mess.Cherry 2000 is like Mad Max but madder. It doesnt really seem to know what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything. That said there is fun to be salvaged amongst its bonkers sense of humour and the people in it seem to be having a good time. A guilty pleasure for some perhaps.",5.0,254

Aaron1375, Strange movie of the future.,This movie has a most excellent device that if it were to be invented would most likely cause the demise of the human race. Yes the female sex robot. You just know guys would happily forgo real women for the super sex starved droid that can not have children does not have that time of month and is always in the mood. Granted it can only make you a burger and fries for dinner but that is more than most women know how to do these days anyway. They could probably make a male version for females but their heads would probably explode because no matter how hard you try to program it to act perfectly it will still somehow set a woman off by making her mad or by making her cry the robot would then just short circuit because no matter what it tries it fails. Yes this is going to get me into a lot of trouble if my girlfriend ever reads this but my sense of humor is very strange and I am getting a good chuckle. Well on to the rest of the movie. Man and his robot chick start having sex and water gets into the droid and it short circuits. Kind of a flaw right there as you would think they could make these things waterproof. Well he finds out it is impossible to fix and the dealer tries to sell him a newer model but our hero will not have none of that as he is sort of in love with his bot and so off he goes to a bizarre forbidden zone to find another Cherry 2000 (the name of the particular model of bot he covets). He gets some help from a very attractive Melanie Griffon character and there is a cool scene with a car and a tunnel of water and then our hero gets captured by this weird group in the desert/forbidden zone place. He gets help from a lady he knows but the main guy in this place is a tad insane though actually somewhat friendly too. The movie is kind of all over the place because at times it is seemingly trying to be a comedy and at other times a Mad Max type adventure.

timmy_501, Fun B Movie about Sexbots,Cherry 2000 is a nifty B movie that takes place in a not too distant future where some unexplained apocalypse has occurred and made items that were once plentiful scarce. Human relationships have broken down so much that every interaction has to be arranged by lawyers and hooking up at a bar involves a lengthy legal contract. Its no wonder then that our protagonist Sam prefers to stay at home with his sexbot a vintage Cherry 2000 model who is essentially a traditional subservient housewife. Unfortunately during a frothy romp in front of the dishwasher his Cherry malfunctions leaving him no alternative but to hire a guide to take him to the dangerous zone to find a replacement model at the robot junkyard. This guide turns out to be a spunky independent woman (played by Melanie Griffith!) and...you can probably guess the rest but that doesnt mean it isnt fun getting there. While its true that several plot points wouldnt hold up under close scrutiny this is a B movie so that sort of adds to the charm. No real complaints here and it was interesting seeing Griffith in that role.,7.0,257
13Funbags, Somehow better and worse than you would think.,If narrow comedy is a thing this is it. Most of the jokes are in the premise and signs on buildings. The plot has quite a few holes and things that just dont make sense. She tells him they dont want to be wandering around Zone 7 in the daylight then they get there in morning and drive around all day. Was that a joke? The end was very predictable but I was still surprised for some reason. Definitely worth watching once.,5.0,258
januszlvii, A Must For Melanie Fans,"I love Melanie Griffith and she is great here. She plays a tracker named ""E"" ( for Edith Johnson) who is hired by Sam Treadwell ( David Andrews) whose love robot Cherry ( Pamela Gidley) is accidentally short circuited and he wants a replacement ( but they do not make them anymore). The strange thing about Sam is he is attracted to robots. Not only Cherry but his ex wife Ginger is as well I should say there is a lot of cheesy humor in the movie but that is to be expected with Tim Thomerson ( Lester) in the movie. But beyond the humor is a underlining message about growing up and acting like an adult or living your life like a man-child. Sam at the end was given that choice does he want to continue with a robot who can fulfill his every desire and loves you because she is programmed to do so or should he choose a real woman ( E) who loves him for who he is and can make your life better? Spoilers ahead: He does the right thing and chooses E ( much to her surprise). Will E be easy like a robot? Of course not she is a real woman and very tough but she is someone you can enjoy company with not just sex ( although Melanie ( like Pamela Gidley) ) is hot. Again a must for Melanie fans.",8.0,259

lambiepie-2," ""The Real Desperate Housewives of Orange County""","The first time I saw ""Cherry 2000"" I saw it on the Los Angeles area ""Z"" Channel and if I remember correctly when they showed this film it was not scheduled for theatrical release. I think they were showing movies of Melanie Griffith because ""Working Girl"" had become so popular at the time and they were showing what a range this actress had from action-adventure to abused secretary. And Melanie Griffith does have that range.Cherry 2000 didnt look finished when I saw it but what I loved about ti was its story. Ive all but forgotten about it until recently when one of the premiere movie channels showed it. In looking at it now it could easily be renamed ""The Real Desperate Housewives of Orange County"" - this film was really perceptive for 1987 - and its only 20 years later! There is a running joke in the film that makes me review Cherry 2000 this way - back then I didnt catch it. Today its really funny.The joke: They ask the man looking to replace his robot where is he from? He replies: Anaheim. Thats in Orange County. Why is it a joke? Well...Cherry 2000 was a female robot that was made as a companion for men. She was blonde pretty perfect breasts perfect hips very attentive to her man had an A.I. chip of all the right things to say all the right things to do.Cherry 2000 was perfect for coming home to when he had such a long day at work. This man was used to his Cherry 2000 and his A.I. Cherry 2000 program that was programmed to look sound and do whatever he wanted. Unfortunately Cherry 2000 short circuited and he needed to get a new one. In trying to replace his Cherry 2000 he found that it was obsolete. The body but not the chip. Newer models of female robots were available but he was really into his Cherry 2000 (Another running joke is the line: ""Ah yes a Cherry 2000! Great hip action!"") so it was suggested that there might be a Cherry 2000 model out in the wastelands of robots. He could take his pre programmed chip and insert it into one of those Cherrys. Only way to get there was to find a tracker to take him in to the Wasteland and get one.The only sane and semi-honest tracker he could find was a woman - gasp - a real woman Played by Melanie Griffith. Melanie was skilled tough and also...feminine. So this man had to go into dangerous robotic wasteland territory with a real flesh and blood woman to find a Cherry 2000 robot that he thought was the only woman that could make him happy.As I pointed out the story was a good story the acting was fine the production and post production values were light which took away from a lot for me as I watched it. It was kinda on the ""Mad Max"" level of production but for this story it needed more production values to succeed.It is a cautionary tale - and it looks as though it was perceptive. We are there especially in Orange County with the pre-fabricated programmed woman. This is not a ""Stepford Wife"" per ce. But it is an ideal and a manipulation of what some men think a woman should be say and do all by the flick of a control - easy to control as flipping on a light switch. That is until - you re-insert yourself among real humans real women non altered flesh and blood and find out what youre really missing which our male does.A funny nice low-key production cautionary tale action love story film.",5.0,261
mrbeankc, Great parody,Now weve all seen the Mad Max movies and their clones. The punk rockers living in the post nuclear desert terrorizing everyone. But in Cherry 2000 the bands of outlaws in the desert look more like Young Republicans than punk rockers and they prefer to have cook outs. This parody of Mad Max type movies is a fun way to spend an evening in front of the tv. Melanie Griffith is great as E Johnson a tracker hired to find a memory chip for a robot. Seems the robots owner broke it while having sex with it. Now the only replacement is out in the wastelands where bands of yuppies roam and they dont like visitors. Youll be surprised at how good a film this is.,9.0,262
craig.duncan, The perspective of someone who saw this movie in 1988,"An entertaining competently made film.What may not be immediately apparent to those who were not immersed in the zeitgeist of the mid-1980s is that this film is not purely satirical science fiction. In 1987 both of this movies main future premises  that autonomous artificially intelligent robotic ""perfect companions"" would exist as consumer products by about 2000 and that America would suffer a partial political collapse in the same decade  were not particularly outlandish.While Cherry 2000 is presently achieving cult film status it was originally received as a much more conventional SF movie.",8.0,263
jellopuke, Brief moments of OK,Overall its a disjointed mess that flirts between action comedy satire and drama but never nails any part. Its very Mad Max (on a budget) and the overall plot of looking for a new sex robot is so unappealing that you can never like the main character. They try but the script is just too messy to work.,4.0,264
Imdbidia, A non-spoof spoofed movie,A road-movie and science-fiction film which has become a cult film that is funny and entertaining despite the downs.The film has a great inventive and a good premise and the characters are a priori quite attractive. However the script is badly developed the acting is pedestrian and the special effects are very cheap so you end laughing at he result not getting engaged by a futuristic story. In other words this looks like a spoof movie instead of a sci-fic one which is what pretends to be. If the movie had been presented as a comedy and not taken itself not so seriously I would certainly have rated the film higher as I laughed more than with many comedies.The cast counts with a very young Melanie Griffith in the role of the naive but daring E. Johnson and with David Andrews as the sexy-hero Indiana-Jones of the future Sam Treadwell who dont seem to have any chemistry on camera and do not shine in their performances. However I found Pamela Gidley good and believable as robot Cherry 2000 and Jeniffer Mayo deadpan hilarious as Ronda.Sometimes we need to eat a gourmet dish and others we fancy a burger. Well this would be the burger!,4.0,265
JamesHitchcock, Second Cousin to a Belisha Beacon,"""Cherry 2000"" is a sort of post-apocalyptic science fiction Western a cross between ""Mad Max"" and ""The Stepford Wives"". The year is 2017 thirty years in the future when the film was made in 1987. Following some unspecified apocalypse America is divided into at least two parts. In the big cities civilisation goes on much as before. The deserts of the American West however have become a lawless wilderness dominated by violent gangs similar to those in the ""Mad Max"" films who roam the desert in cars or on motorbikes.The film does not dwell much on futuristic technology with one exception. The central premise of the film is that before the apocalypse science managed to perfect humanoid robots. The main character is a young man named Sam Treadwell who owns a ""Stepford Wives"" type female robot who acts as his housekeeper and sexual partner. As these robots are programmed to have warm and affectionate personalities and never have a headache at bedtime Sam is very happy with this arrangement until his beloved short circuits during a love-making session on his kitchen floor. This presents Sam with a problem. His lady-friend was an obsolete model the ""Cherry 2000"" no longer being manufactured but he knows he will not be happy with a more modern replacement. (If the number 2000 was supposed to indicate the year in which Cherry was first manufactured this is yet another in the long list of sci-fi predictions which have proved sadly premature- human colonies on Mars by 1987 and all that sort of thing).Sam discovers that there is a supply of Cherry 2000s in an abandoned warehouse and decides to recover one and install the previous models memory chip. There is however one further problem to be overcome. The warehouse is situated in the now lawless desert beyond the pale of civilisation. He therefore enlists the help if Edith ""E"" Johnson a ""tracker"" who makes a living through guiding people through the wasteland but in order to reach the warehouse they have to avoid the attentions of Lester the leaders of the gangsters who now control the desert. Sam also runs into his former girlfriend Elaine now Lesters mistress and the sort of neurotic foul-tempered woman who could drive any man into the arms of a robotic substitute.The film is intended to be an action-adventure story but it suffers from one fatal weakness; it stars Melanie Griffith. By playing a tough sassy character Melanie was obviously hoping to get away from her bimbo image but the inconvenient truth is that most of her best performances have come in films where she either plays a straightforward bimbo (as in ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"") or a bimbo with hidden depths (as in ""Working Girl"" or ""Born Yesterday""). Here as Edith she seems hopelessly miscast. Her normal blonde locks are hidden beneath a lurid red wig making her look like the second cousin to a Belisha beacon but she makes no attempt to disguise her high pitched breathy little-girl voice hilariously inappropriate on the lips of a tough action heroine. She would probably have been better playing the robot Cherry the girl with the artificial carefully manufactured bimbo personality.There is occasionally some sharp dialogue; I liked for example the exchange when Elaine told by Sam that her new boyfriend Lester is a psychopathic killer snaps back ""Dont impose your values on me Sam"". (This does not however imply that Elaine is deeply in love with Lester; her only reaction to his death is ""Well no sandwiches for him""). The action sequences are not badly done but as I pointed out when reviewing the original ""Mad Max"" there should be more to a film than the quality of its car crashes. None of the actors make much impression other than Griffith who makes an impression for all the wrong reasons. Overall ""Cherry 2000"" is a rather dull bit of eighties sci-fi marred by miscasting. It is sometimes described as a ""cult film"" but cults whether cinematic or religious are often mystifying to those who are not already True Believers. 4/10",4.0,266
bowmanblue, It has to be seen to be believed,I watch a lot of so-bad-theyre-good films but Cherry 2000 was actually quite different. It was a so-bad-I-dont-know-if-its-real kind of film. I literally sat there unable to believe my eyes at what I was witnessing. Its set in some sort of weird future where men can buy robots shaped like beautiful women who will wait on their every needs. However what one such man obviously never read in his wifes instruction manual was that you should probably never get them wet.I wont go into the hows and whys of how he gets his Cherry 2000 model wet (theres a treat in store for you) but it totally blows a fuse and the local dealer seems to be out of stock in that particular make. Therefore the only thing he can do is set out into a forbidden wasteland where theres – apparently – a robot graveyard full of perfectly-kept Cherrys waiting to be taken back to some lucky mans kitchen.So he does. Only he doesnt do it alone. He enlists the help of a tracker – someone whos familiar with the dangerous world theyre about to explore. This particular tracker is played by Melanie Griffith. And this is where the fun starts. That is if you call fun really bad acting. Melanie Griffith cant act. Or to be fair she cant act back in this particular film. I read online that she had just given birth weeks before filming so perhaps I should cut her a bit of slack. But she really is bad. Every line is delivered like shes reading if from a childrens comic (and not a very well-written comic either).You could almost say that she ruins the movie but that would be a little unfair. The guy whos hired her tries to out-ruin the movie too. Hes possibly the least charismatic leading man ever. Plus he doesnt seem able to close his mouth – ever. Therefore with two such awful leads you could imagine many people would have turned it off as soon as possible. But thats where its appeal lies – you have to watch it to see just how bad it gets.Plus theres the script itself. Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino would struggle to act well delivering these lines. Its like the writers were students who had a good idea for a film but none of the talent to bring it to the big screen. The action scenes dont make sense. The dialogue doesnt make sense. The progression of the story from scene to scene doesnt make sense and finally the character motivation doesnt make sense either.Cherry 2000 is a disaster but one of those car crash type disasters that you just have to watch. You need to know you are in for a bad experience when you sit down to watch this. It is bad but it is so bad you really do have to see it to believe it.,6.0,267
Hey_Sweden," Take note of this one, B movie lovers.","Sure its all too obviously influenced by ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"" but its still consistently engaging entertainment for cult film enthusiasts. Credit has to go to production designer John Jay Moore and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin for giving it just the right slightly futuristic look and its got some gorgeous rural vistas to take in. Its a little episodic but its also got some energy and some nifty moments.Melanie Griffith offers a delightful performance as female ""tracker"" E. Johnson (the E stands for Edith) hired by lonely man Sam Treadwell (a fairly stiff David Andrews) to take him to a dangerous area where he can find a replacement for his robot wife Cherry (Pamela Gidley). On their journey they run into colourful characters played by such wonderful acting veterans as Ben Johnson whos endearing as Six Fingered Jake and Harry Carey Jr. as Snappy Tom.You know youll be in for a good time when you look over that supporting cast: Marshall Bell Laurence Fishburne Michael C. Gwynne Brion James Jack Thibeau and Robert ZDar. The always welcome Tim Thomerson has a particularly amusing role as an unconventional desert dwelling despot whose followers have it in for people such as Edith. Overall the movie isnt overly flashy but its pretty exciting at times especially the entire sequence with the crane and the water pipe. The soaring score composed by Basil Poledouris (""Conan the Barbarian"" ""RoboCop"" etc.) is fine accompaniment.Although Thomerson as Lester shows himself to be a serious psycho this never gets too too unpleasant with director Steve De Jarnatt keeping the action moving and having fun with the offbeat little details provided by screenwriter Michael Almereyda (story credit goes to executive producer Lloyd Fonvielle). ""Cherry 2000"" does know how to send you away with a smile on your face. It may have gotten a limited release in theatres in the 1980s but 26 years later it proves enjoyable enough to deserve a rediscovery.Seven out of 10.",7.0,268

Griffith proves shes as versatile as a wet cloth but its not about her or the dad from Terminator 3 with these apocalyptic movies its the wealth of bizarre support that the ill has to offer.From Brion James right up to a film stealing Tim Thomerson its a film thats not going to break any genre boundaries but if you a fan of those cheap films made in the eighties like Spacehunter Land of Doom or World Gone Wild this is definitely for you....,6.0,269
BA_Harrison, Cherry Bomb!,A recent article in The Telegraph predicted that by the year 2050 human-on-robot sex would have overtaken human-on-human sex; I reckon they could be right if the robots look anything like this films titular model the Cherry 2000 created to fulfil its owners every desire. Blonde beautiful and obedient Cherry (Pamela Gidley) seems like the perfect match for Sam Treadwell (David Andrews) which is why he goes to such great lengths to find a replacement body for her memory chip when a frolic on the kitchen floor results in some serious blown circuits. With the only Cherries still in existence to be found in the robot graveyard of Zone 7 a desert wasteland inhabited by dangerous psychopaths Sam hires the help of pretty tracker E. Johnson (Melanie Griffith) and comes to realise that his ideal woman might not be battery powered after all.Director Steve De Jarnatts other film Miracle Mile is an almost flawless example of 80s apocalyptic cinema—an extremely tense darkly humorous and touching example of low-budget film-making revolving around a compelling dilemma—what would you do if you discovered that WWIII was imminent?Cherry 2000 a post-apocalyptic adventure that takes place in the near future of 2017 (next year as I type) also poses an interesting question—will sex with a machine ever be as satisfying as the real thing?—but despite a much bigger budget than Miracle Mile the film proves far less successful thanks to an awkward blend of genres its clumsy episodic nature and questionable performances. Writer Michael Almereyda and rookie director De Jarnatt must shoulder much of the blame the slapdash story and chaotic direction leading to some really disjointed sequences including one spectacularly ill-conceived action set-piece in which our heroes cross an obstacle via electromagnet. Griffith is the films other obvious weakness—she looks lovely (even with her bad hairdo and dubious wardrobe of tasselled post-apocalyptic attire) but fails to convince as a tough cookie who can handle almost any situation.Cult actors Robert Zdar (Maniac Cop) Tim Thomerson (Trancers Dollman) and Brion James (Bladerunner Enemy Mine) join in the fun but can do very little with the messy material (which might explain why Thomerson doesnt even seem to try). Also keep an eye out for an early appearance from The Matrix star Laurence Fishburne in a role that hed most likely rather forget about.,4.0,270
peterpants66, Bone machine,"Cherry 2OOO is a little flick out of 1987 about a guy named Sam Treadwell who bears a striking resemblance to Don Johnson whos out to pick up some chick named ""Cherry"" in a robot graveyard out in zone 7. Melanie Griffith is a tracker whos job it is to find things in wasteland America after some kind of nuke attack. Steve De Jarnatt directed this epic and another a year later called ""Miracle Mile"". Both films deal with the fallout of human life after a worldwide disaster that puts 90% of humanity back into serfdom. The movie is expertly cast and the shooting locations throughout are awe inspiring. My first taste to this sweet truffle came as many great viewings do on Cinemax. The movie is laced with B-movie royalty Brion James Robert Zdar Tim Thomerson and Pamela Gidley round out the stacked cast in this truly invigorating thrill ride. Lots of stuff gets blown up plenty of costly stunts performed and in the end the bot gets got. The story is about a guy with an expensive ""Cherry 2000"" sex bot played by the always sensational Pamela Gidley. She breaks down after a heavy night of dishes and Sam goes on a crusade to get her back online. Tim Thomerson plays one of the figure-heads of the post world he kills the role of Lester who must have read a lot of self-help books before the blast as hes always reminding his guys to ""be themselves"". Lesters crew is made up of other psycho survivors who enjoy bingo and dancing and killing and wearing cool outfits. The movie addresses some interesting ideas about the future of courtship with all the diseases now it seems like a robot girlfriend is probably the way to go but their not human their just cold machines.

I wonder sometimes how such a movie gets produced (like how did Michael Nesmith get Repo Man out of the Hollywood grinder?).My DVD front cover lists Melanie Griffith and Ben Johnson but not David Andrews who was excellent. A more well-known male lead would not have worked (in my opinion). Tim Thomersons part is memorable.

Woodyanders, Offbeat and enjoyable tongue-in-cheek 80's futuristic sci-fi/action winner,Mild-mannered businessman Sam Treadwell (a likable portrayal by David Andrews) hires roughntumble ace tracker E. Johnson (a delightfully feisty Melanie Griffith who looks great with fiery red hair) to take him into a dangerous region known as the Zone in order to find a replacement model for his beloved Cherry 2000 android (the extremely cute bubbly and enchanting Pamela Gidley) after the original blows a fuse. Director Steve De Jarnatt does a sound job of creating and sustaining an engaging lighthearted tone offers a really funny and funky depiction of an oddball future where romance and intimacy have become exceedingly rare commodities stages the action set pieces with considerable verve further spruces things up with a fine line in amusing sarcastic humor (the group of blithely loopy and lethal happy health freaks Sam and E. encounter in the Neveda dessert are hilariously terrifying) and gives the picture a certain quirky quality thats impossible to either dislike or resist. Andrews and Griffith display a pleasant chemistry and make for attractive and appealing leads. Tim Thomerson almost steals the whole show with his marvelously batty turn as crazed and charismatic psychopathic cult leader Lester. Moreover there are bang-up supporting contributions by Ben Johnson as amiable old-timer Six Fingered Jake Harry Carey Jr. as doddery fuddy dud Snappy Tom Michael C. Gwynne as sage robotics expert Slim Brion James as no-count hood Stacy and Robert ZDar as menacing behemoth Chet. Michael Almereydas witty script delivers a trenchant critique of gender roles and sexual politics with some interesting stuff about the lack of communication between both sexes and an inspired inversion of the standard action movie cliché with a tough chick protecting a wimpy guy. Jacques Haitkins slick cinematography gives the film a bright look and makes nifty occasional use of vertical wipes. The lush and lively orchestral score by Basil Poledouris likewise hits the stirring spot. A cool little flick.,8.0,276

Recall how we felt happy when the brides veil was lifted?Do we cheer for anyone in this one?Is there anything funny about this one?The slobby low-class cow they have in this one is enough for you to hurl. Is it still categorized as a ""comedy"" is it is not funny?",3.0,287

custar55, Dammit!,Only good part was the barbershop scene. This movie needed Darryl soul glo more McDowells and a different reason to come back to America. They were in America for 5 minutes.

mosurataksaichan, Is this really a sequel?,"Ill keep this brief.This is a bad film that doesnt contain any of the DNA that entertained us so many years ago. The story is weak struggling to tie in plot references to the original film.. Where was the ""2 America"" part to this film? Maybe 15 minutes of this film had visible New York locations? The product placement as well... was blatant and obscene. Save your time and rewatch the original. A far far superior film to this disaster.",3.0,294

jonreastwood," Terrible. Even without Covid, this is straight to video/streaming stuff","Terrible sequel. The first third provides a nostalgic return of many characters from the original which admittedly brought a few smiles and then goes downhill as soon as the truly atrocious Wesley Snipes is introduced. A real problem is that the ""coming to America"" part is so short lived. Thats what made the original funny; the fish out of water tale. The story line involving a genXer going to Africa to wonder in a CGI backdrop world was neither interesting or funny. There would have been so many more options of a buddy movie storyline for Murphy and Hall to shine in but they went with a large portion of the film ignoring the multitude of talent from the original and having a romance between two characters nobody cares about. They could have just done a 90 minute movie based at the barber shop in Queens and it would have been more entertaining. They are lucky movie theaters are still closed as this would have been direct to streaming in any case.",2.0,310
baumer, Terrible sequel,Another reviewer in here mentioned that for everything that Cobra Kai gets right in the nostalgia department coming to America part 2 gets wrong. It seems like almost every character from the first makes an appearance in this one. But where they get it wrong is that very few of these characters really add anything to the movie. And someone forgot to tell them that coming to America was a comedy because coming to America part 2 is void of laughs. People sometimes hyperbolize when they are angry at a movie they thought they were going to like but in this case I can be honest with you and tell you Im not exaggerating when I say I didnt laugh once in this film.One thing that brings this film down is Tracy Morgan. He brings down most films that hes in and here he adds nothing and hes annoying most of the time. The Leslie Jones character is flat-out horribly written as well. Theres not one shred of honesty in anything that she says or does with the exception of her reaction to getting bathed by the royal bather.Where as the original had charm and humor and a lot of fun characters this one recycles the same old jokes except they dont work this time. Eddie Murphy maybe just isnt funny anymore. Hell always be a comic genius to me but maybe you just get complacent and lazy when you get older.The runtime was around an hour and 45 minutes and I think a half an hour of it was spent on dancing. It felt like every 15 or 20 minutes there was another 10 minute dance sequence. You do it once but three or four times just gets to be excessive.Unfortunately the characters that we do like from the original like Lisa McDowell and her father Louie Anderson and especially Semi are just given cursory glances and really dont have anything to do in the film. We needed more soul glow and more sexual chocolate and more humor. We might have even needed John Landis to bring his eye for detail to the film.Coming to America joins the ranks of other horrible sequels to beloved films. There is even a sequence in the film where two of the characters talk about the sad state of Hollywood and that all that really exists right now are superhero films remakes reimaginings and sequels to films that nobody asked for. They should have realized that instead of this being tongue-in-cheek it was actually 100% true.1/10,1.0,311

nikmcrae, Don't even bother.,Boring and very poorly written. They pulled this story out of a hat and soiled Akeems character as well as Semmi...Really? Semmi got Akeem so messed up that he didnt realize he was basically raped by some trashy broad from the club? This tarnishes the love story of the original film.The love story in this one is forgettable. I also find it interesting that this was another forced attempt by Hollywood for female empowerment. Of course the girl was gonna be allowed to be queen when its all said and done. Do I have a problem with that? No. But the forced narrative is an issue to me.Ill say this though to me the most entertaining scenes all involved Wesley Snipes. I found his character to be hilarious.

hecklerandjokmm, Wow I guess consent is one sided only,So wonder women 84 told us women dont need to get the consent of men when they have sex with them. This film tells us that Leslie Jones character a woman didnt need to ask for consent from Eddie Murphys character when having sex with them. Are these screw ups and double standards the problem of western society and its pandering to feminists yeah probably they are hypocrites. This film is as funny as not asking for consent is. Trevor Noah and Leslie Jones is in this if that isnt a red flag to how awful this is I dont know what is. The start had white people are evil and privileged trope that keeps going around in a film about black royalty whos more privileged than rich people of colour. No self awareness in this film. The Princess is oppressed more than the poor guy from Queens? This film is written by an idiot. The film is about female empowerment these women are so empowered they cant commit crimes and are above consent. The original characters are sidelined for the new ones. The pacing is terrible. I wouldnt recommend this to my worst enemy.,2.0,317

It felt like a parody of the original ""Lion King"" and ""Black Panther"". Just skip it. Its really not worth it. Its just playing on blatant nostalgia with so many nods to the original that Its practically a remake and a very bad one at that. It felt like the film was specifically designed around including as many nostalgic moments as possible down to some of the same costumes but cheaply made this time. Just like the whole film.

letande, Didn't happen...,"* SIGH * And here it is the second ""blast from the past"" disappointment in a row... First weve got Tom & Jerry with Spike crapping all over the place and now? Now weve got this. Like everybody else I loved the original movie. Together with Trading Places it was like one of the best comedies from eighties. So even though I tried to keep my expectations here as low as possible to avoid being disappointed much I still hoped for good. Like Agent Mulder? I wanted to believe. Unfortunately... yeah. You know how it is. Didnt happen. Like... at all.First of all its exactly as forced as you may expect. Every single scene and every single line here screams ""forced"". The original Coming to America was daring it was fresh and well it was... you know... FUN. This? Its just a forced mess. One of those movies that you forget right after youre done watching. Heck it was actually hard not to fall asleep here. The main idea wasnt really that bad (long story short the new movie tried to focus on Zamunda instead of Queens) but writing is so terrible that... seriously how many people worked on the story and screenplay here?Coming 2 America (the one who came up with the title alone should be punished) is one of those movies where some random people talk about some random stuff and you just sit there wondering why in the freakin world should you care and when this torture will finally end. Watching this movie? Its like visiting your distant relatives. Its kinda boring its kinda awkward and you cant stop thinking about just how much you want to go home. And guess what? The movie is almost two hours long so Im really glad that I watched it at home where it was easy to take a break and do some more exciting stuff. Like watching the paint dry for example. Watching this movie in one sit? Its plain boring. Sure humor is a subjective thing but while I laughed all the time while watching the original (still do) this time? I didnt even smile once. Its THAT uninspired. Every time there was an attempt for a joke I was like ""good grief seriously?"". The original impact so-o-o inst here...Also its a bit too woke. In a bad way. I mean dont get me wrong. I like woke stuff. Adds quite a lot to the impact as long as the writing is right. Then again you know how it is. There are times when such stuff feels natural. When it does make you care. And there are times when it feels painfully forced out of the place and actually plays against the writing. You cant just make things interesting and exciting just by saying the right things you know? You need a good writing to make people feel involved. Here? It feels like nobody even cared. They took one of the most popular comedy movies from eighties theyve tried to re-create some of the most famous parts (like those scenes in the barber shop) theyve tried to copy / past some of the old jokes (without much success since like I said the original impact is long gone) theyve added some woke stuff just because its a right thing to do and BOOM! Your new Amazon Prime movie is ready. Seriously guys those female Ghostbusters were more funny and exciting than this. And I never thought Ill say that. Like... ever!The only thing I actually liked was Akeems daughters (one of which is played by Eddie Murphys real daughter Bella) but guess what? Theyve barely used the characters. Seriously even though there was like a ton of potential the girls barely appeared at the beginning and near the end of the movie. While the rest of the thing was just our painfully generic stuff from all those Eddie Murphy movies nobody really cared about. You know Dr. Dolittle Nutty Professor... I really wonder if the man is cursed or something. After the initial success in movies like 48 Hrs. Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop the movies with him started to feel EXTREMELY forced in uninspired. And this one? Heck even Meet Dave was more funny than this.Not only Coming 2 America was unable to repeat the original success its also one of those sequels that actually ruin the original quite a lot. Not only its forced and isnt funny at all it ended up ruining good old characters. Lisa McDowell for example feels absolutely terrible now while Cleo barely have a reason to appear. Not only this movie wont make you laugh theres a big chance itll actually make you feel sad. Just because seeing a great movie from your childhood being ruined in such a poor way? Its... you know... SAD. Dixi.",1.0,324

GuidoWithoutu, Coming 2 Amediocrity,"We all know its a rare case for every sequel to maintain the level of the 1st one in fewer cases it can be even better and everybody like me who loved so much ""Coming to America"" (the only reason why Im giving this one a 5) with its unique gags hilarious catchphrases (McDowell-McDonalds ""Soul Glo"" and its jingle) et cetera of course didnt expect a miracle like that but the trailer seemed at least a fun movie not just a simple machine to make money playing on nostalgia. Even a repetition of the narrative strand of the first would have been better namely the winning duo Eddie-Arsenio (not at all exploited here even if there are both) who tries to find Akeems son in America but no they find him in 5 minutes to then bring him without too much difficulty into the kingdom of Zamunda and the rest of the film has this ""bastar* son"" (line repeated several times ad nauseam) as the main character! What to say its the first time I see Jermaine Fowler acting (Im from Italy and here hes not so famous) I know hes a comedian maybe a good one but didnt have the opportunity to see his comedic talent in this movie and to be honest I would have preferred seeing Murphy most! In conclusion flimsy storyline lots of random dances and songs a flood of under-exploited characters (theres also Eddies daughter Bella Murphy here making her debut as Akeems daughter and playing a couple of lines at most). The only good thing is to see again almost all the old cast and some old characters played by Eddie and Arsenio but (sad to say) both uninspired and not really funny so this reunion cant save alone the whole movie which is a total disappointment.",5.0,329
TheFearmakers, Not Much Without John Landis,"The original COMING TO AMERICA was no accident. It took experienced filmmaker John Landis to pull off what he did for THE BLUES BROTHERS which came out before working with Eddie Murphy in TRADING PLACES: That is blending music into comedy without it being a musical-comedy and very few directors could pull that off and this sequel is proof... they still cant.Its understandable that the semi-retired Landis isnt on board but in trying to recreate that same magic originally sparked by the collaboration of Landis and Murphy with only an older overweight Murphy on board just doesnt feel or look right...The biggest problem is his son from Queens Jermaine Fowler with a loud annoying mother. Then again their Bad Sit-Com style fits this contrived sequel more than the once-great Murphy again alongside sidekick Arsenio Hall who like all the other familiar faces seems to be going through the motions. The only new characters that kind of work allowing Fowlers ""young Prince"" to stretch beyond the intentionally recycled plot is KiKi Layne as his half-sister reluctantly aiding in a dangerous task...And Nomzamo Mbatha as his royal hair-cutter and basically the new version of Sheri Headly: a free-thinking bride to change the age-old rules. Unfortunately this love story is far too rushed to matter inserted into the 11th hour what took the entire original movie to pan-out more naturally and humorously.",2.0,330
AndrewLianBellerby, Embarrassingly Terrible.,I cant express how much of a disaster this film is. Id avoid at all costs. Why?

dtnmusic, ED-EEE... ED-EEE...,Probably the most surprising sequel ever! Like 33 years later thats hilarious in itself. Eddie and Arsenio were great together in pt 1 so I was happy to see both of them back. Plus I havent seen much of Arsenio lately. The premise is great in that Akeem left a little secret behind in America and its time to answer that call. So much time passing works well for that premise also. I dont want to give anything away as its not exactly a thick plot. I will say some of it plot and jokes was predictable. Sequels always have that uphill battle. But overall it did the job and as far as I was concerned the surprise of it simply showing up after all these years won me over. Dont overthink it just enjoy it.,7.0,333

deanbeckton, Unwatchable...,This movie is beyond terrible we turned it off somewhere around the 30-40 minute mark as we literally couldnt take anymore and we really really really tried to give it a fair chance.I dont want to get carried away but its hard to believe this actually got made.The story is so forced and disjointed and doesnt know what it wants to be that its uncomfortably frustrating trying to figure out just what the point in this movie is because it certainly isnt to make you laugh.Eddie Murphy is simply an empty shell of the comedy actor he was in the 80s in fact the whole cast are empty shells here; theres nothing behind their eyes except dollar signs... its actually quite sickening to see them take advantage of their audience like that. I do get it of course its easy money and theyd be stupid not to take the gig but at least put in some effort ugh why do I do this to myself?...Anyway...theres zero spark in any of the characters and nothing is really driving them. Theres no chemistry between anybody in any scene (that we saw) it actually felt awkward to watch the whole time.The actors are simply saying their lines like its painful for them to speak not one of them looks like they want to be there. Which brings me to the dialogue..... Im not even sure I even want to go there because its so cringe inducing. Nobody talks like that in real life.Well theyve already made their money and its pretty clear thats the only thing anybody cared about while making this embarrassment to cinema.It truly saddens me that this is the best they could come up with at this moment in time.Ill leave it there before I have a breakdown.

t-ktinney, Eddie! Eddie! Eddie? Why?,This is one of the worse movies Ive ever seen and one of the worse movies Eddie Murphy has ever made. Besides being boring not funny stupid and just desperate they brought back every previous character and shouldnt have. It seemed like filler to add time to the movie since there was a silly storyline that had nowhere to go or develop. Wesley Snipes character is so over the top that I couldnt decide if it was bad or so bad it was good.And theres too much music and singing and dancing (ALL BAD TOO) that it also felt like movie filler since the storyline and characters had nowhere to go and nothing to do.Basically a great classic movie Coming to America was given a lame stupid boring and honestly a pathetic sequel that Eddie Murphy should be embarrassed to have made.

flicklover, Why Eddie? Why?,Coming to America is one of Eddie Murphys most charming and funny films. The idea if going back to his character of Akeem and bring back most of the cast for a sequel sounds good right? But when I saw the trailer for this sequel I was not expecting much. Trailers especially for sequels should make you excited to see them. This one didnt. And after enduring the hour and 45 minutes of this film I can see why the trailer was so bad. There was no good laughs to put in it!!!This is one of the worst sequels ever made. I know that it was released straight to streaming but I feel that Paramount must have had no confidence to release this in theaters. Yes I know that theaters are virtually empty because of COVID but if this were released under normal circumstances I think it would have failed at the box office. I get that sequels are mostly cash grabs these days and are almost always inferior to their originals but the dip in quality of this film compared to the first one is gigantic!!! It is not only unfunny it is aggressively unfunny!!! I might have chuckled once or twice but it was seriously unfunny. It obviously banks on yhe nostalgia that people have for the original and tries to hit the same beats but fails miserably. They bring back just about every actor from the first film here but it feels like its just they were brought back so people could acknowledge that they came back nothing more!!! But worse is Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. All of the chemistry they had in the first film isnt here!!! They are just not funny. What they do is supposed to be funny but it just isnt. They both play multiple characters again many of the same ones they did in the first one liked the old guys in the barber shop but the scenes just didnt work for me!!! I wanted to laugh but just didnt. Eddie Murphys performance seems phoned in. He doesnt seem to even want to be there. He can be so funny and in the case of the first film charming. There is none of that here. The supposed story here is that Akeem now King finds out he has a son in America. Akeem goes back to Queens to meet and bring his son back to Zamunda so he could become heir to his thrown. Also there is a plot point about a militaristic dictator of a neighbor nation played by Wesley Snipes demanding one of Akeems daughters marry his son. All of this is more or less done like the first film but without any laughs or charm. I just dont get why so many funny and talented people could be so unfunny. It doesnt help that this sequel comes 33 years after the original film. Nostalgia could only take you so far. Last year Bad Boys For Life did what this film couldnt recreate the feeling and chemistry between its leads and deliver alot of good laughs. Unfortunately Coming 2 America failed miserably in doing that. The first film is a very funny and charming fantasy. This has none of what made the Coming To America enjoyable.The fact that almost everybody that was in the original is back and that didnt help says alot. Also I think that the prior film being directed by John Landis helped. He was a very reliable director of comedies. The new director Craig Brewer doesnt seem to have the chops for this material. Bad script lazy performances from your star equals disaster.I dont know why but Eddie Murphy sequels seem to just be bad!!! I think the only sequel to an Eddie Murphy hit that Ive liked is Beverly Hills Cop 2!!!Very Bad sequel here maybe the worst in his career!!!Grafe: F.,1.0,347
hassanmha-75894, No plot no comedy and political,I am a massive fan of the first movie and I came with low expectations to this one considering it is made during the Covid period. I was hopeful that it will be decent in the light of the same cast. This movie is bulilt around positive messeges but it is simply forced and feels out of place in this movie. What makes things worse the comedy is just missing and dry. This movie does not have any of the magic and appeal the first one has.,4.0,348

Just like most I really wanted to love the sequel that I waited for for all these years. People just want to laugh. We dont need Hollywood to tell us how we should think or believe. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply out of respect for Eddie Murphy. He has given me so many laughs during my life. He just failed on this project.,2.0,350
aliromario," Weird pace, forced cringy hiphop soundtrack","Big fan of the original. This sequel is just embarrassingly bad. Extremely weird pacing with awful editing.Didnt anyone on the set yell out ""cut cut .. one more take"" ? Because the whole movie needs another take.Huge admirer of Eddie Murphy loved his performance in ""Dolemite is my name"" and was hoping he would continue in fine form (also Craig Brewer the director).Sadly Eddies performance is the weakest one in the movie. Can it be his worst performance yet?In the lead up to the movie I watched Eddies interviews where he claimed ""we have gone above and beyond with the sequel"". The end result couldnt be further from the truth. Awful direction filled with lame and cheesy ""Kardashian"" type jokes just to keep up with the times. It just seem so forced.I wished they kept the R rating and the grimy grainy dirty New York look of the original. This movie looks so crisp almost like a HD soap opera tv show.The original was such a classic because of the ""raw"" feeling that the supporting cast like Frankie Faison (its a damn shame what the did to that dog) contributed with.

corpse_man," Predictably ""modern"" retread of the original","From the 40 min I watched It seemed just like a more politically correct version of the original. From the moment in the beginning of the movie where it showed the daughters kicking ass with their Ninja style training I basically knew the whole plot right there I concluded the son was going to be an incompetent fool and the movie is going to be about how the Kingdom should go to the daughters. Why did assume this? Because Ive seen the same plot about 50 times in the last 2 years.To be clear nothing is wrong with the idea of equality its great im all for it Its just the fact the same plot has been in pretty much every movie in at least some form in the last 2 years. ""Damn the evil patriarchy"" and women are just as good as men just as strong just as fast just as smart etc etc. Im im not even getting into actual biology here.Im really confused why there such a hard push for this lately there was plenty of strong female leads in television and tv even 20 years ago. For example Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 Ellen Ripley in the Alien(s) films Captain Janeway in Star Trek Voyager Samantha Carter in Star Gate SG1 I could go on and on and these were all VERY strong female characters from around 20 years ago who were all strong leaders very intelligent independant and physically capable in combat (even if they couldnt beat up every single man in the world). And back then the shows were just enjoyable and not so blatantly crammed with the anti Patriarchy message at the expense of having an actual plot.For those of you who have seen the film Noelle a movie about a female who becomes the new Santa Claus and fights against the patriarchy this is almost the exact same film plot just in a ""Coming to America"" package.If this movie came out 30 years ago I probably would have loved it and found it inspiring fresh and brave. But at this point in time its just predictable trendy band wagon jumping over political boring crap.I clicked on the button for containing spoilers but really the entire movie can be predicted easily in the first 5 min anyway.Can we for the love of god just have a fun comedy this decade thats not about the evil patriarchy?",1.0,355

skeletornumber70, Maybe Disney can still make unique films,"Of all the evil witches monsters dictators and homicidal maniacs that populated classic Disney animation Cruella Deville might be the most hated. Sure she never had plans for world domination and she never even tried to murder another human but she did the one thing that film audiences can never forgive: she tried to kill puppies. Its for this reason that Ive been so skeptical about this film an origin story that attempts to humanize this character by shedding new light on her turbulent past. The cast sounded stacked and Craig Gillespie is a director Ive admired ever since ""Lars and the Real Girl"" but was it possible to tell a sympathetic Disney-fied story about someone we know will wind up a would-be dog killer?Well the answer is yes and no but mostly yes. Before I praise this film for being such an unexpected gem let me get the couple of problems I have with it out of the way. First and foremost without giving any spoilers I never get the true sense that Cruella is as pure evil as shes supposed to be by the time we get to 101 Dalmatians. Shes definitely no hero by any means but theres not a point where I feel the audience will stop rooting for her. The only other complaint is that theres a bit of a tonal inconsistency at times as if the film doesnt quite know its target audience. Its certainly not for children not only is it dark and mature but its so much of a character study that young kids would be bored yet there are certain occasions that feature very ""cartoonish"" logic that adults will have to suspend a lot of disbelief over.But on to the good and the first point of praise is the cast. Emma Stone is absolutely brilliant in this role and you can just sense that shes having the time of her life playing it. Almost just as amazing is Emma Thompson as the vile Baroness and when the two are onscreen together the chemistry between the rivals is electric. As far as the supporting cast goes there really isnt a weak link to be found with a particular stand out in Paul Walter Hauser who is hilarious as the dimwitted thief Horace. As for Gillespies direction the film is beautifully shot and he brings the same stylistic energy he brought to ""ITonya"" though its greatly enhanced here due to the 1970s punk rock aesthetic of the film. This leads me to the soundtrack which is not only pure awesomeness but is used to turn Cruellas story into an almost allegory for the transition of London music scene in the late 60s-early 70s.I could go on and on about the individual components that make this film work but the truth is what really makes it work is how well these individual parts come together in a seamless fashion (no pun intended). In another time perhaps I might be more critical but honestly its been a while since Ive seen such a major studio blockbuster especially one based on an established property that feels like its actually the unaltered vision of a filmmaker. The story the cast the music the style everything all fits together to make something truly satisfying. Thats how movies are supposed to be made and with that I give this my first strong recommend of 2021.",9.0,377

elwynchofmann," It's not changing cinema, but its full of style and a fun time",Cruella is full of style and a pretty good time. Emma Stone does great in the titular role and her presence really ups the enjoyment. Starting off with the good: the production design costuming hair and makeup are so great in this film. Emma Stone gets to rock a ton of different hairstyles and the period-piece aspect gives opportunities for the costuming team to really show off. The architecture is beautiful and it does a great job of transporting you to this period in London. I definitely anticipate this film to get some love at the Oscars in those categories. The film is also very colorful and vibrant at times which was fun. The first act was a bit slow but after about 45 minutes it starts to pick up nicely.Where the film faltered for me was definitely the script. Its not a bad script by any means but it definitely could have been polished up. Some of the villains motives are completely nonexistent and the screenplay makes no attempt to try to explain them to the audience. It was a bit jarring because I thought it would get cleared up in the third act but they just gloss right over it. The film also doesnt pack any big emotional punch which isnt a bad thing or even necessary - it just holds it back from being anything great. The film has a good use of licensed music that adds a lot of style to the film in a similar vein to Joker. However this did lead me to be a bit underwhelmed by Nicolas Britells original compositions which left little to be remembered.Cruella honestly surprised me and I have to say I enjoyed it quite a bit. Its not changing cinema but its fun stylish and great time back at the theater. Definitely one of Disneys better live-actions and I definitely recommend seeing in a theater if you can!,7.0,379
tm-sheehan, Wonderful romp- Wicked Queen Raveena meets Harley Quinn,"My Review- CruellaMy Rating 9/10I had a hunch Cruella would appeal to my taste when I saw the trailer but that often can be a disappointment but not in this case.Cruella excelled for me in all Departments Script Set Design Costumes Performances and most importantly entertainment value.What a superb pairing of Acting talents the dynamic duo of Emmas with Emma Thompson as The Baroness and Emma Stone as Estella and later Cruella DeVil .Both these fine Actresses are Oscar Winners and both show why they are winners in Cruella  each in equal costarring roles.The blending and chemistry between these two women is so obvious as is the fun they must have both had in performing their respective roles.Its interesting to note that another great actress who portrayed Cruella DeVil Glenn Close is an executive producer on this project.I couldnt help comparing these two devilish characters to Raveena the Wicked Queen in Snow White and Emma Stones character to Harley Quinn colliding in a Devil Wears Prada fantasy for adults and children alike .If you have a bit of a Camp sense of humour and appreciate superb Costumes by double Oscar winner and ten time nominated Costume designer Jenny Beavan plus a great escapist romp youll love Cruella Im sure.I think while children over say 10 may enjoy Cruella its an Adult fantasy comedy Fairy Tale  very inspired I suspect by Ronald Dahls style of madness and mayhem.""Cruella"" is set in 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution and follows a young grifter named Estella a clever and creative girl determined to make a name for herself with her fashion designs. After traumatic events that see her alone and defenceless in London Estella is befriended by a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief and individuality. Joel Fry as Jasper and Paul Walter Hauser as Horace have some of the best comedic moments in Cruella as two street wise ruffians who like nothing more than to ""Pick a Pocket or two. They form a trio with young Cruella assisting her with her quest to be a fashion designer by devious means in gaining her employment at the famous ""Liberty"" Department Store.Estellas flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute played by 2-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson. Emma Thompson has never looked so chic her sense of comedy timing with sarcastically cruel one liners is superb .The Baroness and her best new fashion designer Estellas relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.Other standout performances in this ensemble are John McCrea as Artie Estellas Camp fashion ally and Mark Strong as the valet to the Baroness.The Soundtrack to Cruella is fun and enjoyable with retro pop hits plus a fun Score by Nicholas Britell to set the action along at a cracking pace.Walt Disney Pictures announced the films development in 2013 with Andrew Gunn as producer . Emma Stone was cast in 2016 and also serves as an executive producer on the film alongside Glenn Close who previously portrayed Cruella in the previous live-action adaptations.Cruella had a huge estimated budget of $200million so it needs to be a big hit movie for Disney and I hope this film succeeds .It must be seen on a Cinema Screen dont wait for it to stream its such a beautiful production and its creativity needs to be seen as intended on a giant screen.Based on the book 101 Dalmations by Dodie Smith the 5 screenplay writers Steve Zisses Kelly Marcel Aline Brosch McKenna Tony McNamarra and Dana Fox have done a wonderful job at melding the prequel to Cruella DeVil to the classic 101 Dalmstions and possible sequels .",9.0,380

msbreviews," Cruella is not only one of 2021's biggest surprises, but it's also one of the best films of the year so far.","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews please follow my blog :)Besides Cruellas greedy necessities purely evil personality and extreme vanity this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable: skinning short-haired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur. Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stones Cruellas defining character traits which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material as if times and culture didnt change from decade to decade.Since the start of Disneys live-action remakes campaign audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste version of the same story while others desire a completely different take on the well-known narrative. However the best experience - and the primary goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isnt a remake but an origin(al) story based on a classic villain... And its undoubtedly one of the best films Ive seen this year until this day! I didnt expect to write an extensive review but with so much to address I know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article.Let me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into ""deep analysis mode"". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually but its how it differentiates Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone wears the viewers can easily decipher what character shes playing. The differences between the glamorous rich people that the Baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated through their wardrobes.The extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy costumes but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britells score carries little references to the music of the other installments as does the film itself. Craig Gillespie doesnt hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the runtime of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically its as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen the CGI backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake of The Lion King.CGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However the VFX dont look good enough causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this a specific outdoor location thats quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark fake background that just feels way too off. Finally the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the more ""logic-driven"" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this a nitpick especially since its not a film without silliness.In fact Cruellas success partially rests on Gillespies tone balance. Jasper and Horace become the comic-relief characters starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from. Now some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun. However Dana Fox and Tony McNamaras screenplay carries undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker. Estellas life story is far from being a happy tale and Cruellas rise even less. Overall the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic depressing traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled but there are a few moments where Gillespie lets it too loose especially in the over-Disney-ish last fifteen minutes.So lets address the two protagonists: Estella and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenixs take on Arthur Fleck / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation Emma Stones character follows a similar arc but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered self-indulgent Baroness which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business. The Baroness despicable treatment of Estella brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures.An unexpected clever twist pretty much completes the protagonists transformation which genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didnt have high hopes for this origin story. Nevertheless the well-written screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations. While its true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous Baroness Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly I wouldnt mind seeing a sequel but I dont think theres room for another film that wouldnt hurt the one we just got. So theres just one more aspect to delve into: the casts performances.Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling connection to Estella one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They become a family living and stealing throughout their lives but when Estella starts giving Cruella some screentime a few issues arise within the trio. These problems are indeed approached and solved but in a less dramatic manner than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent rational Jasper but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance is rarely affected by the characters comedic banter which is something the actors also deserve credit for.Emma Thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography interpreting the Baroness von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her role and the only reason why she doesnt steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating.Nevertheless Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that shes one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood Stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities. Without looking at the screen any viewer will be able to know if shes talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character but the mannerisms alter as well. It would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar nomination so her chances are obviously thin. However if there was an award for Best Monologue Stone would be a strong contender.I dont recall how many minutes it really is but I cant forget that long uncut take with Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella in the span of milliseconds her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt character-defining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one but two impressive attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for.Cruella is not only one of 2021s biggest surprises but its also one of the best movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin(al) story about one of Disneys classic villains. Dana Fox and Tony McNamaras remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella transformation giving her non-dog-killing emotionally compelling motivations a traumatic depressing past and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever Emma Stone delivers an award-worthy display interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations. Technically the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen dont overcome the predictably Oscar-winning stunning costume design as well as the gorgeous makeup & hair wonderful production design and sweet score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this one of Disneys best live-action films in the last couple of decades.Rating: A-",8.0,383
HabibieHakim123, My Personal Best Movie In 2021 So Far,"""Another Shadow In The Cloud Phenomena happened again in Cruella i made a thing called Shadow In The Cloud Phenomena which means the movie did have a bad scene a weird scene or a boring scene but in this case is an ok scene and then comes this scene that was so good its make me hype its make me amazed then i erase that whole thing i know it sounds weird or non sense but whatever i dont care everyone have theyre own thing and again Cruella isnt perfect from the beginning till the middle then come this whole greatness and awesomeness and it burns all that out Emma Stone is a very very perfect cast as Cruella De Vil the supporing actor was good and funny the cinematography was surprisingly incredible the music is all perfect everytime they put the music it always a great song the costume was fascinating Cruella is so far my personal best movie in 2021 replacing Godzilla Vs Kong in my number one place for best movie in 2021 Cruella is just a perfection i highly recommended""",10.0,384
adamstommy, It's...amazing?!,Its...amazing?! I know shocking right?! After many Disney live action duds Cruella brings something fresh to the table! This movie is an absolute blast! The Emmas are great in their roles the sets are great and the costumes are jaw dropping. Great job Disney!,10.0,385
captainlangley," Original, creative, and humorous","This movie surprised me and by far surpassed my expectations. Heres why:1. The plot was original creative and humorous.2. The costumes were very well done.3. For once there wasnt any political agenda.4. Disney always includes a message in their movies but this time it was actually subliminal instead of the focal point. As the aforementioned states it also wasnt political which is a big plus.5. There was a point in the movie that I like to call a ""false ending"" where they leave room for a sequel but instead of ending the movie it keeps going to the next chapter. It makes the movie feel like a long one but in a good way.These are all attributes of an excellent movie and my faith is Disney has been restored because of it.",8.0,386
reviews4musicals, I've waited 5 years for this movie and my expectations were high.,"It has been 5 years since I first heard of this movie and lost my head expecting a Maleficent remake with my favourite villain ever. I was so excited and went in with high expectations hoping for the best and to be honest I was surprised despite a few small things I picked up. I know the reviews have been hit and miss so far but this one really did it for me. The costumes were amazing a real stand out along with the sets and the music as well (all definitely Oscar worthy). The acting was spectacular particularly from Thompson who made a fabulously hideous monster out of the Baroness. Stones portrayal of the famous Cruella De Vil was brilliantly exhibited and many of her scenes (particularly the fountain scene near the end) were my favourites in the film. However who things in particular stood out for me. Firstly I believed this film was supposed to be a prequel to Glenn Closes portrayal of the classic villain. However many things did not match up between the two films. The timeline was screwed Anita and Jaspers race Anita and Rodgers professions Anitas relationship with Cruella. Basically all of Anita as a character did not correspond with the 1996 film and the character even being names ""Anita Darling"" was unnecessary. She was a smaller role and definitely could have been a side character but not so small that this didnt stand out for me. Also the graphics in this film were particularly wonderful (the fire and the dogs particularly). However the ocean at the end are possibly the worst examples of computer animation I have ever seen. This was a real letdown for me and almost ruined the end. However the film is so wonderfully written and engagingly eventful no one should let any of these faults ruin the experience for them. Cruella is a brilliant film and should definitely be praised as one of Disneys better live action movies.",7.0,387

The dialogue is not for everyone some people may think its kinda pretentious/cringey but I personally like it. Have I mentioned that the costume design is stunning?

sassyaminakaram, Disappointed.,I was really looking forward to this movie because of the trailers but when I saw it i hated it. As an original Cruella fan: The movies entire first half hour is completely unnecessary. That whole pre-origin-story origin story just drags the movie down even if on its own it could make for a fun Disney Channel Original Movie. They did the original cruell dirty both Maleficent & Maleficent: Mistress of Evil are honestly better.,1.0,396
cricketbat," It has a very interesting look, but it's not my style","Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look but its not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of ""show dont tell"" by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence as it distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I dont mean to be cruel but this unnecessary film is an overly long series of disjointed scenes.",4.0,397
garethvk, Cruella Is A Wickedly Delicious New Look At The Classic Character,"Back in 1961; Disney adapted the 1056 Novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians and in doing so; crafted a beloved animated classic and introduced the world at large to Cruella De Vil. The film has not only endured but has spawned television series a direct to video sequel merchandise and two live-action versions.Despite being delayed due to the Pandemic; Disney has scheduled the much-anticipated ""Cruella"" for release and I am happy to announce that the film is a Wickedly Delicious new entry into the series.The story follows young Estella as she and her mom plan to start a new life in London in the 1960s. When tragedy strikes the young girl finds herself on the streets and working a life of crime and grift with fellow street kids Jasper and Horace.Flash forward to the 1970s and Estella (Emma Stone) toils away in a store cleaning while hoping for her shot in the world of fashion. When fate arrives and places Estella in the path of vain self-centered and vicious fashion magnate The Baroness (Emma Thompson); who hires Estella to begin her career in fashion.The savage way The Baroness treats those around her intimidates Estella but her friends Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser); see this as an opportunity to rob from The Baroness and this places them at odds with Estella as her designs start to gain traction.When situations clarify and things begin to evolve into a mission of revenge; Estella transforms into Cruella which had long been the name associated with the darker side of her personality.Cruella takes the fashion world by storm for her innovative looks bold designs and theatrical events which upstage the Baroness at major fashion events.With her sales and reputation in decline The Baroness declares war on Cruella which sets a dark and sinister series of events into motion which drives the film into darker content then one may expect from a Disney film.The cast is very strong as Stone and Thompson are amazing as they are both wicked and captivating without ever going to far over the top or extreme with their characters. The supporting cast is great as well as Fry who was hysterical in the series Plebs brings a depth to Jasper which takes him above just being a stumbling sidekick.Mark Strong also does great work and elevated all the scenes in which he was in with his strong presence. While at first I wondered if we really needed to have this part of Cruellas life told; the story is engaging and the cast is fantastic which makes this movie dark and delightful.While elements of it may not be ideal for younger viewers; the story was captivating and the performances were amazingly engaging.The film ran about two hours and 10 minutes and seemed a bit long in one segment but the film does regroup brings the story home. There is a mid-credit scene audiences will want to stay for as it was an unexpected and very charming nod to what is to come and is not to be missed.It will be interesting to see if the film is the hit that I expect it to be if Disney will consider more films in the series as it would be amazing to see this cast return for further wickedly dark adventures.4 stars out of 5.",8.0,398

Dash99, Thinks it's smart however it's terribly predictable,"First of all I really want to know why they named this ""Every Breath You Take""? It has nothing to do with the plot or any of its themes so the title of this film is just bizarre.Just went you think this is a different kind of ""obsession thriller"" it decides nope lets just go back to the tropes and genericness of the sub-genre. First of all the twist is incredibly obvious as soon as the antagonist appears and the information were given up until then it is the only conclusion and surprise surprise it turns out to be true.Characters make decisions that make no sense besides to forward plot and the conclusion is as predictable as any other thriller.Some good actors and a very beautiful setting of I assume British Columbia but thats about it from this very generic thriller.",2.0,407
varun-25071997, Nice Concept But Poor Execution,"A nice story executed in the worst possible way. Two talented lead actors completely wasted and the casting of Sam Claffin was so bad on many levels.

JICNZ, Raining In My Heart,"It clearly rained every single day of their filming of this flaccid movie. I genuinely think everyone got depressed by this. True the characters were recovering from the death of a child but still you have to give the audience something to root for some personality trait that makes you want this family to survive. Everything is shot in monotones. Rooms are dark somber. People mope. And it rains. Ive given two stars for the scenery despite the rain. Shot in Vancouver apparently I got the impression the director depressed himself said to his camera crew For Gods sake get some shots of snow-covered mountains emerging out of the mist. Perhaps people will take that as metaphor for hope at the end of this damp squid."" Its not good when youre hoping the psychopath might actually kill the teenager and put us all out of our misery.",2.0,415
ferguson-6, grief results in our disappointment,Greetings again from the darkness. Psychological Thrillers can be quite fun to watch when well-written and well-acted. Its a delicate balance though since if even one of those elements is lacking the enjoyment level plummets and the eye-rolling begins. Unfortunately this film from director Vaughn Stein (TERMINAL 2018) and screenwriter David Murray (his first feature film) is a masterclass in eye-rolling despite a well-respected and familiar cast.Oscar winner Casey Affleck (MANCHESTER BY THE SEA 2016) and Michelle Monaghan star as married couple Dr. Philip and Grace Clark. He works at a Psychiatry Institute and shes a local Real Estate Agent. An early scene shows adoring mother Grace driving their young son to hockey practice. Tragedy strikes and since that night Philip and Grace barely speak to each other or his teenage daughter (by another mother) Lucy (India Eisley daughter of Olivia Hussey). All three are grieving in their own way - emotionally isolated from the others. Grace aggressively swims laps day and night in the pool at their stunning modern mansion. Lucy has been expelled from her private school for snorting cocaine during Science Lab. Philip immerses himself in his work with clients and we know hes smart because hes wearing glasses.One client with whom Philip takes a special interest is Daphne (Emily Alyn Lind DOCTOR SLEEP 2019) a troubled young lady from a troubled family. To help Daphne deal with boyfriend issues Philip uses unconventional personal therapy which he then presents as a Case Study for students ... against the wishes of his boss and friend Vanessa (Veronica Ferres). This backfires when Daphne seemingly commits suicide and her grieving brother James (Sam Claflin THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY) shows up.At this point everyone is grieving and Philips career begins to crumble as hes blamed for Daphnes suicide. James turns on the charm for Grace and Lucy and even though the characters dont get it every viewer will recognize whats happening why its happening and where its headed. Even this would be fine if things played out in a clever manner rather than over-the-top and obvious. Even the Rorschach inkblot tests used as artwork in the pristine Clark mansion are cause for eye rolls. Claflin probably has the most fun of any with his role but its Monaghan who comes closest to molding a full dimensional human out of her character. Affleck just adds yet another despondent joyless character to his resume ... though he does get to throw one tantrum while sitting in his car - alone of course. Fortunately these actors will assuredly move on to projects more worthy of their talents.In select theatres and premium VOD on April 2 2021.,4.0,416
madmaywebdesign, Good film,I dont understand the bad reviews. This is a good physiological thriller that is worthy of a decent rating. The storyline was pretty simple but had some good twists.

A_Different_Drummer, predictable slow-cooker that does no one proud ...,Not the actors -- and definitely not the audience. Monaghan at 45 is still trying to transition her career from being the grand prize in every rom-com done in the 1990s to a serious actress. She was awesome in the streamer Messiah but the political correctness police killed the show. Eisley at 27 is still trying to bring back the heat she showed as a teenager on national TV. It will be a very difficult transition. She was awesome in I AM THE NIGHT but lost here. And Affleck is still trying to show that he is the better actor of the two brothers. He is actually but this movie is definitely not the venue to prove it.,5.0,418

jophetroot, Entertaining movie - prequel to the series,Ferry is an all round entertaining movie that tells Ferry Boumans story and life about 15 years before the series Undercover will take place. Frank Lammers as Ferry and Elise Schaap as Daniëlle carry most of the movie. As we will see how their romance started.Ferry is the right hand of a rich Amsterdam based drug criminal Brink (Huub Stapel). After they get robbed by other criminals an ordeal that goes bad. Brink sends Ferry to his home region Brabant to take care of matters and have their revenge. We see that this will change Ferrys life. Some thing he could not have expected to happen.On the downside i missed a bit in character development. Some of the dialogue and interaction could use a bit more depth.The pace of the movie on the other hand is on point and will keep you focused. All in all an enjoyable watch!Must-see for those who have seen (and liked) the Netflix series Undercover.Houdoe!,7.0,427
halcyonbear," Brutal, funny, touching.",Admittedly this film is probably very much one for the fans of Undercover. If you arent already familiar with Ferry from that series you might not be as excited about this film but if you enjoyed the series you wont feel let down by this movie prequel.Yes some major characters from Undercover are missing but given that this is a prequel set a good few years before season one it wouldnt make sense for them to be present. Instead Ferry is placed front and centre and we get a great backstory to the events that ultimately led to him being investigated in Undercover.Chronologically you could watch this before watching Undercover but I liked the fact that I already knew aspects of Ferry and Dani prior to watching this and Filips cameo is definitely funnier.Its brutal in places as weve come to expect from Undercover but there are also touching moments and humour too. Frank Lammers imbues a character that could very easily have been a two dimensional monster with a degree of sympathy. If Undercover continues (and I hope it will) we dont know if Ferry will make another appearance so this is potentially us saying goodbye to him. Ill definitely watch this again.,7.0,428

jga999, Predictable story,"It is a story about a criminal who meets a girl. This leads to trouble. Frank Lammers plays his character well and his acting lifts up the whole movie. Elise Schaap is less convincing just smiles naive into the camera too often. Her script is very cliché. The overall storyline is thin and predictable halfway I guessed already what the catch was and what will happen next. Some call it a thriller on this platform but there is little suspense and no action.Having said that it is a good film for a casual Friday evening entertainment but do not expect too much. This is a prequel to the series ""Undercover"" which is a very good and entertaining series to watch.

marcvand, Nice Snack (frietje Jopie),Waited for a long time and got what you hoped for.Its a great prequel but nothing more. You can see from the script that it was made under time pressure. Story shows little tension and has no plot twists and innumerable mistakes in time (The film plays in 2006) for example you an see a guy with mouth mask in his car.Only a short prologue shows Ferrys childhood. The rest of the film shows a period less than 1 year as an adult. The writers have made themselves too easy with this choice. But this also has the advantage that there is room for a next sequel:Ferry II: The king of XTC in Noord Brabant.,7.0,441
svl-99543, was a bit disappointing,That Ferry would be less visible in part 2 of the series was of course to be expected since an UNDERCOVER cannot go undercover twice with the same criminal. Only when it turned out that the criminal became the general publics favorite especially in the Netherlands was that not really useful for the seie. Something that the Belgian products probably did not expect when they wrote season 2. I kind of got the idea that Netflix then hastily created a movie or the character Ferry for all those people who after season 1 thought that the series was about Ferry. The script therefore seemed hastily written and was not nearly as strong as that of the series.,5.0,442

arungeorge13," Predictable gangster fare, but hits the right notes! [+60%]","A prequel to the Dutch Netflix series ""Undercover"" (that I havent watched) Ferry is an engaging gangster drama that tells a rather predictable story. What happens when Ferry Bouman (with a troubled childhood) returns to his native place to locate a rival gang and finish them off? There are certain formulaic elements at play but director Cecilia Verheyden and writers Nico Moolenaar and Bart Uytdenhouwen never let viewer attention go astray. We get to know more about Ferry in each scene (I cant recall a scene where he isnt present) - he is definitely a grey-shaded human but we root for him because his heart is in the right place.This has of course everything to do with Daniëlle (a bubbly Elise Schaap) a woman he randomly meets while on the job. Theres occasional humour interesting-yet-familiar narrative beats and adequate pacing. The cast and the cinematography need to be applauded for pulling it off quite well. Ferry ticks the appropriate boxes as a crime drama with shades of action with Frank Lammers tough-guy act leading from the front. As an origin story Ferry did grab my attention and piqued my curiosity to watch Undercover sometime in the future.",6.0,446

christopherlang-79872, Fleshes out a great character,Im normally a bit wary about the movie spinoffs to tv shows. Deadwood and El Camino spring to mind neither doing anything to enhance the parent show. This one managed to hit the right notes the premise is very simple and we get to see extra dimensions to Ferry Danni and John which will only add to undercover on repeat viewings. Really enjoyed this.,8.0,453
dwp1948, An Enjoyable Movie But Lacks Any Excitement Or Suspense - Good Actor/Actresses,"06/14/2021 The actor Frank Lammers (49 y.o.) plays Ferry in this movie just as he did in the two year TV series titled ""Undercover"" which I enjoyed. This movie was an OK movie for me but rather predictable as it played out. It is a one time only watch movie. Bon Appetit",7.0,454
Nemesis42, Highly Satisfying.,From the first to the very last scene this crime thriller is packed with meaning. With a romance at its core this tight story is captivating. It has a fantastic and justified ending the protagonist moving fluidly from one family to the next. Well cast and performed. The main character draws us in and is so easy to empathise with. This is what we want - character connections. Well done to the film making team. Thanks heaps for the watch !!,10.0,455
bjorncouwenberg81, A great introduction to the past of Ferry,"Lets keep it short:Great movie as long as you dont expect it to be ""Undercover - season 1 - part 2"". Its a real prequel.

jelteg, Boring,The acting is decent except for Huub Stapel (Brink) and Ferrys sister who looks and acts like a joke. Also Ferry cannot hide his age which makes it uncredible that Danielle is attracted by him. These credibility issues downgrade the movie.The story is quite predictable it needs a lot more depth. I wish John Zwart would have got more screentime and I miss another supporting actress.So all in all I give a 5/10.,5.0,459
Noviomagum," Ok.., not far fom good",Im not disappointed. Thats something new for me with the few dutch movies ive seen in recent years. I wouldnt have watched this if it wasnt for the excellent series Undercover. Frank Lammers is clearly at his best i wonder though if he can give the same level of performance in other roles. Elise Schaap is a great actress. Elise plays a naive small town girl fom Brabant. Though Elise is not from Brabant as Danielle in the movie she speaks the accent. Thats admirable but as a native Brabander i hear her trying and its not ..eh..native. Huub Stapel playing a druglord from Amsterdam trying hard to insert an Amsterdam accent wasnt convincing at all. So Eline and Frank made the movie. They connect very well. The story is thin it is what it is with hardly any full lines let alone a deep conversation. Basically everything is said with a few words. But thats ok it suits this movie and the characters. Hopefully there will be a next part and maybe if possible with this story and these characters a bit more depth and surprise elements...,7.0,460
Maafushi, Entertaining but unbelievable,Onemanshow with.some small parts for other familiair Dutch actors. Dont expect a lot of character development or great scenes with class acting. The story is quite predictable and turns mostly around the relationship between Ferry and Daniëlle. The speed is decent and therefore is it fun to watch in the end. Certainly if you ignore the sloppy murders in brought daylight.,7.0,461
chad_muskater, The Dutch Scarface,"This film is actually excellent. It is well written the photography is absolutely on point and the character development flawless. Frank Lammers plays the charismatic Ferry Bouman with a steady pace without ever making you challenge whether this guy existed or not because you wish he hadnt for being the ruthless criminal he is. Outstanding work by the director Cecilia Verheyden who also knew exactly what to show to click with the fans of the ""Undercover"" series without letting the new viewers unhooked and lost with references.This film is indeed even more violent than the Undercover series but those moments are necessary to understand the depth of the show based on it as it happens that the show itself lacks background on Ferry making him in the process an anti hero instead of the criminal you supposed to condemn.Please do not hesitate to watch if youre a newbie in the world of ""Undercover"" and if you are not this will be your film of the summer.",9.0,462

So the two extra stars are well deserved. Unlike those run of the mill movies (here is looking at you: ""Say hello to my little friend""). So 11 out of 10.",10.0,465

erinkimie, Great movie that displays the true Hawai'i,People saying that it was a cheap remake of the Goonies completely missed the point of the entire movie. It had a beautiful message of staying true to your roots the importance of family and respecting native cultures. Showing the real side of Hawaii with local values pidgin olelo Hawaii customs and history was the best part of the movie in my opinion as someone born and raised on the islands. The Nightmarchers scene was my absolute favorite and was so touching and powerful. The local portrayal of Hawaii is almost never scene in mainstream media so this was refreshing. Also casting actual Pacific Islanders Kamehameha grads and people born and raised in Hawaii was awesome. A great family-friendly movie.,10.0,471
sandydee-44404, Absolutely loved.. family friendly,"My daughter and I watched this movie tonight and absolutely loved it. Being from Hawaii and now living in the mainland it was fun to watch this movie... yes its very much like goonies but the infusion of the Hawaii culture language and folk lore made it all the more special. The night marchers story was very similar to what we were taught growing up as was the pidgin and infusion of Hawaiian words. Loved that their home was authentic with glass jalousie windows and tons of wood paneling. The filming of most of the film appears to be in Hawaii and they even have Halona beach from "" from here to eternity"" in it. The cast looks like the majority of them are from Hawaii which is refreshing considering the majority of the tv shows filmed in Hawaii have lead characters who are not from Hawaii and butcher the Hawaiian Pidgin and culture. The family relationship is realistic and my kids could identify with the siblings. It was.clean and light hearted. I would recommend to anyone but if your not from Hawaii put the closed captioning on for the Hawaiian words. 💛💛",9.0,472
lingeringdreamer, Great fun and true to Hawaii,As someone born and raised on Maui I tend to be a bit critical of films set in Hawaii since they tend to be made with a weird tourist POV.

aquamoon1, Fun Family Adventure!,I enjoyed this movie very much. Its not something to get Oscar nods but it is a fun adventure movie suitable for family watching. Its a movie you can watch to escape for awhile and end with a smile and feeling a little bit lighter. Its very reminiscent of Goonies but thats okay. Why not have a modern treasure hunt feel-good movie like Goodies? We could all use a feel-good adventure movie these days especially one the whole family can watch together. I would definitely watch this again.,8.0,474

IonicBreezeMachine, A mixture of treasure hunting adventure and family melodrama that stumbles at first but finds its footing as it goes on,"Pili (Kea Peahu) has her sights set on attending a Geocaching camp but after her grandfather (Branscombe Richmond) has a heart attack Pili must forfeit her prize and go to Hawaii with her mother Leilani (Kelly Hu) and brother Ioane (Alex Aiono). Once there Pili finds a journal among her grandfathers possessions that tells of a group of privateers who hid a cache of gold on the island and sets off to find the treasure unaware of the dangers surrounding it.Directed by TV sitcom staple Jude Weng and written by comic book/screenwriter Christina Strain whose work can be seen in cult favorite TV show The Magicians and Netflixs upcoming series Shadow and Bone Finding Ohana marks another original by Netflix. Finding Ohana feels like a mixture of Lilo & Stitch by way of National Treasure and while there are good elements on display the movie is a little clumsy out of the gate.Kea Peahu makes her debut here as our protagonist Pili and brings a natural energy to her performance that is engaging. She does a good job conveying the drive stubbornness and arrogance of her character and has some nice moments of vulnerability and pathos throughout the film. YouTube personality/singer Alex Aiono makes his film debut here and for the most part does reasonably well but sometimes the clunky material especially early on doesnt allow him to make the best impressions but despite this he does feel engaging and falls comfortably into his role as the older brother dealing with an overly energized mischief prone sister. The supporting cast is also quite good. Kelly Hu despite a somewhat limited role plays her role as a struggling single parent trying to juggle multiple crises at once quite well and Branscombe Richmond plays the curmudgeonly grandfather character quite well and has some very sweet moments with Kea Peahu as Pili where they convey a genuine sense of family. But easily the best performance is Owen Vaccaro as Casper a nerdy overly cautious neighbor who Pili (kind of) befirends who gets some very funny scenes and lines in the movie. Vaccaro was previously seen in The House with a Clock in its Walls playing a lead and its nice to see him here again giving another good performance.The movie itself is very hit and miss the opening is very clumsily handled with characters often telling us about situations rather than showing us them and while the characters feel like theres a richness to be explored for engagement and pathos it often feels like those take a backseat to shenanigans and very on the nose humor. Theres also not much in the way of drive at the beginning of the treasure hunt as the movie just kind of ambles along from one marker to the next. The flashback sequences are also rather underwhelming as theyre subject to a running gag where the characters in the flashbacks will speak anachronistic dialogue as dubbed by Pilis Kea Peahu that is somewhat chuckle worthy upon first impression but becomes kind of grating upon repeated use. By the half way point I was ready to label this a very ""meh"" movie but then it kept going.After a flabby first half thats haphazardly delivered the movie course corrects and makes its stakes more dire and adds some tension and drive thats been missing from the movie up to that point. Without giving too much away theres some scenes of visual wonder and danger that all tie into the themes of family and Hawaiian mythology quite well and actually make the movie feel more engaging as it goes on.Finding Ohana is clearly meant for a family audience and as a family film its perfectly decent. The acting is spot on from everyone involved and the exploration of Hawaiian mythology is quite fascinating (though admittedly Im unaware of how accurate it is) and the sense of adventure is quite fun once it gets going. Unfortunately clunky writing and an overly slow pace in the first half create some hurdles the movie needs to work around but once it finds its footing it becomes an engaging adventure.",6.0,481

chazsmith-01093," Terribly acted, terrible script, terrible movie.",Bootleg Goonies movie without the charm of it. All actors in the film are horrendous and cringeworthy in most scenes. The sets look incredibly fake. Some of the heart-to-heart scenes I had to actually look away at how terribly acted it was. Also find the camera angles jarring and almost like a Z-list low budget TV show. How this movie got 81% on Rotten Tomatoes Ill never know. No charm totally uninspired plot awful script and cringeworthy dreadful acting.There is also a ridiculous scene where the characters start singing (ridiculously autotuned) while traversing a lava lake just totally weird decisions all throughout this movie. I give it a 2/10 as kids ages 3-7 will most likely enjoy some of it. As a Netflix movie youd expect a decent budget but it genuinely looks like it was made with less than 200k. Dont expect even close to The Goonies or Indiana Jones (although there is a weird cameo from Jonathan Ke Quan (Goonies and Indiana Jones) . The ending is what totally throws the movie even more off course what is with the supernatural turn it takes with ghosts? Makes absolutely no sense and totally not inline with what the movie was about!

delzog, A wet dream for the non-Hawaiian,"This movie was really-really stupid. Its like some Hawaiians wet dream of what Hawaii should be ... but isnt. First nobody lives like this in Hawaii! Ive lived on 3 islands for over 30 years and I can assure you that this movie is a parody of Hawaiian life. From the hick cars to a guy thats about to lose his house on Oahu for not paying 5 years back taxes ... thatd be like losing a million dollar home and land for about $10K in taxes.Then theres the language and speeches of EVERYONE. Nobody talks like this here. Pidgin? Sure! But not like they portray.The way they treat kapuna and heiaus would or should insult just about every local here.The portrayal of the living conditions all the way to the POS island cars is ludicrous at best. This would be right for a person living in Puna on the Big Island (but doubtful) but the islands dont allow junk cars much (safety inspections required here) ... lots of rust buckets but thats about it.The use of a box of spam by a kid to reach the pedals on a car?! Not even.Everybody like ""ohana"" and always giving away fruits fish etc... Hawaii is friendly the people great but this?! No. And the way it tries to shame the Hawaiian thats moved to New York is shameful in itself.Much of this is a rip of other shows ... especially ""The Goonies.""Casper the white-redhead haole kid is typical of the stereotyping of this show.The lack of respect of these people especially the young to the older generation is plain silly for Hawaiians! I tell you aunty ever here her keiki give lip or stink eye like dat she giveem the slippa!Anyway this show is a four at best and thats because theres not enough Hawaiian motivated movies and it tries to portray the island as something magical (which it is) but in a horrible fashion!

There was an equally nasty feminist/female empowerment thread that I found distasteful where all the men were portrayed as idiots in comparison to their female counterparts. It was grossly imbalanced.Believe it or not one character said ""I am frightened to go to New York because it might make me uncomfortable with who I am!""

lakings97, Fun Family Oriented Movie,Finding Ohana is a Netflix movie about a Hawaiian family uprooted from their family home in Brooklyn and move in with their aging grandfather in Oahu to help him with his health. Along the way the siblings find a journal pointing to a long lost treasure that sets them on an epic adventure around the island. The adventure leads them with new friends to reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage. The cast includes the beautiful Kelly Hu as the single mother raising to her two kids and Branscombe Richmond as Kimo the grandfather who had not paid his property taxes in over five years. The kids hope finding the treasure would help save the property. The back story of the pirates were portrayed by SNL alumni Chris Parnnell as well as Marc Evan Jackson they made the story more entertaining. The movie was very family oriented but I didnt care about the adventure but the ending was very heartwarming and the meaning of Ohana brought a positive overall vibe to the entire flick.

It was so predicatable and corny and I kept thinking ""OMG people are going to think Hawaii is like this.""

A Hawaiian family living in Brooklyn returned to Hawaii went on a treasure hunt and reconnect with their Hawaiian heritage.Now Im aware that the movie aims toward family and kids but I just could not like this movie. The acting was pretty bad especially the main kid. I felt like she tried too hard to be edgy. The dialogues and jokes were mostly cringe and cheesy. When the characters retold the lore the movie used the Ant-man lip syncing. Now in Ant-Man Michael Pena was great the lip syncing worked very well. However the lip syncing was quite bad and unfunny in this movie.The theme of movie was about reconnecting with ones heritage. I really liked the theme but I dont think the story delivered and emphasized the theme enough. I dont feel connected enough to these characters to appreciate their change at the end even though the change was pretty obvious.I still liked some part of the movie particularly the interesting Hawaiian lore and culture.

Its definitely a family movie if you can get your family to sit still long enough to watch it. Could it have been a better movie ... certainly?

vergeofchaos-60-49100," Fun to watch with the kids, but sickeningly woke.","This is a great movie to watch through the eyes of your kid(s). Its a fun Goonies ""homage"" (they brought in Jonathan Ke Quan to validate this movie) but WAY too long. The family moment towards the end was nice. HOWEVER when you see it as an adult its just not good.The acting is atrocious. The only character acted well is Casper. The older brother is an absolute tool an treats everyone terribly. The dialog is just poorly written and embarrassing. The worst part for me is that it follows netflixs woke parameters. All the male characters are bumbling fools weak ""soy boys"" or stubborn mean old men. The only strong characters are females and its perfectly fine to make fun of white people. The white people jokes arent funny just nasty. From constant use of slang for white people to a pasty character named ""Casper"" to complaining about bland food by saying ""what are we white?!"" Its just annoying.In the end its worth a watch with your kids and keep it light. They couldve shaved 30 min off of the movie and made it much less cringy and it would have improved vastly.",5.0,518

nestavb, Goonies rip off,I just am a bit dissapointed in netflix for making the first 30 minutes of this movie a commercial for the geocaching app. also the conversations between the 12year olds during the movie make it so awful to take the pirate storyline serious. The meaning behind some things is good but as usual Netflix movies do dissapoint It just seems like a very very poor remake of the goonies where there was a shortage on budget for special effects and decor. But i do get that your 8 year old would like it. Short summary  too long bad decor pirate storyline is wack.,3.0,558

rannynm, Emphasizes traditions and embracing your culture and family (ohana(,Families do not always bond nicely. In Finding Ohana two siblings from New York embark on an adventure in Oahu Hawaii and try to connect with each other and with their Hawaiian heritage while they discover the mysteries of the island. This movie is about traditions embracing your culture and respect.The film has the perfect adventure spirit. Pili (Kea Peahu) a 12-year-old girl and her brother Ione (Alex Aiono) are always fighting. With their mom they go to their native island Oahu to visit their grandfather whose health is delicate. The mom Leilani (Kelly Hu) doesnt get along with her family all that well. Its as if all these different generations are colliding but through the unusual experiences and with help from new friends they discover the greatest treasure - the love of family (ohana).The movie mixes fantasy and adventure a little romance humor and drama in a fun way. This story remind of Goonies and has some elements from the classic 80s films like Indiana Jones but deals with contemporary subjects of identity and multi-cultural issues. The scenes were filmed on various locations on Oahu which gives the film a very authentic tone. The sightseers are beautiful and there is some lovely underwater photography. The story is entertaining and keeps you focused most of the time. Some visual effects and practical sets are not all that impressive but the performances are very good and make you connect with the characters and what they are going through. Kea Peahu who plays Pili in her film debut is amazing in the leading role. I love the songs in the soundtrack and the way the music is incorporated into the storyline. I also love that the film reinforces the importance of a simple life; sometimes we focus on our dreams and goals; we forget about the beauty that is in front of us in our everyday life.The message of the film is that love of family is unconditional despite our differences.I give Finding Ohana 4 out of 5 starts and recommended for ages 5 to 18 plus adults.

Foutainoflife, 5.5 Stars,This film is inspired by the life of Elisabeth Fritzl and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father Josef.I knew going into this that it is not a big budget movie. This is a lifetime movie. I know that people like to hate on these simplistic made for TV films but I happen to enjoy them regardless. As long as the acting is tolerable and the storyline is decently put together. This film met my requirements.No. It doesnt have the greatest actors but considering the subject matter they were portraying I thought they were fairly good. The subject matter is awful but there is no need to feel as though you will be watching horror level violence or sexual assaults of an overly graphic nature. This is tame in those regards.I personally liked the film. I found it to be a decent watch. If you like Lifetime movies this is going to be right up your alley.

The acting was ok and though the two eldest children should have been nearly adults they looked 14 and 12. Perhaps to showcase the stunt of growth? Idk but my biggest disappointment was the ending. It felt rushed. I would have loved to see her mom and sisters reaction of reuniting with her vs an old flame who we are supposed to believe waited 20 years for her return on the same bike hed been riding since the beginning of the film. I would have loved to see her reaction to the son she sent to be raised by her mom. Maybe even her mom and sisters disgust toward the father would have been great.

jdorego, Lesson for victims too,Disagree with reviews of bad acting. All actors did quite well with what was given them. They had to summarize 20 years into a 90 minute movie so at least it moves fast and keeps you engaged.Yes it may be a lesson for creeps to repeat this crime but it is also a lesson for the people living around it.if a daughter had a shaky relationship with her step or real father and she disappears he likely had something to do with itif he spends a lot of time in the basement after the disappearance check the basementif you check the basement and the size does not match up with the size of the house there are likely hidden roomsif youre a neighbor who sees a flashlight signal coming from the basement dont knock on the door and tell the occupant call the cops to check it out.He may have made the basement sound proof from her and her babies screaming but I doubt that if she banged on the walls or sink that the vibrations would not be heard upstairs.,7.0,567

jennfinn, Based on Monster Josef Fritzl.,Girl in the Basement is loosely based on Josef Fritzl of Austria who imprisoned his 18 year old daughter Elisabeth in a basement prison for 24 years during which time she gave birth to SEVEN of his children. Three kids were raised in the basement with Elisabeth three were raised upstairs by Josef & his wife and one was killed by Josef a few days after his birth. Im stating all this information because reviewer DEEDRALA said it wasnt based on a true story when in fact it most certainly is. Judd Nelson gave a chilling performance as Don the psycho father who locks his daughter Sara in the basement for twenty years. The movie starts with Sara sneaking out to a party with her boyfriend her dad catches her and shes grounded for one week. Don overhears Sara telling her mom & sister that shes leaving as soon as she turns 18 so she can travel the world. We are told Don is controlling and crazy but how does he go from grounding her for sneaking out to locking her in the basement for 20 years ? The man goes from concerned dad to full on sociopath in minutes and Im not buying it. Josef the actual monster who did this in real life showed signs long before he locked up his daughter. He served time for rape while he was married he started raping Elisabeth when she was eleven years old and he started building her prison three years before he locked her in there. Also in the movie Sara looks exactly the same when she leaves the bunker twenty years later they couldve at least aged her a bit. Once again LMN wanted to cash in on a tragedy but they didnt want to actually research anything.,6.0,570

Stasjs, Some stories should not be adapted,"Now I do not usually write reviews on IMDB despite having this account for years but this movie... While the true story this is very loosely based on which is a horrible and vile story this movie feels rushed jarring and has very very little reason to existThe acting is subpar but thats what Lifetime is. The plot and character motives make 0 sense. Then on top of that the tone is just so depressing but just over the top.To start off the fathers motives to lock her daughter in a bomb shelter which by the way...HOW DOES NO ONE KNOW ABOUT THIS!His motives to lock her up rape her and breed her is because shes being a teenager sneaking out of the house. Now if the dad had a scary past like hes a serial killer like in The Stepfather but no. This all comes out of nowhere because of what? Toxic masculinity? No Oedipus Complex? No past of him killing or criminal history. Loss of his wife or even his whole family besides his daughter? NopeAll the side characters are also TERRIBLE! The mother who doesnt wonder where her husband goes all day even after threatening to get a private investigator. Saying she wont go in the basement bc she doesnt like rats or whatever. The sister who was IN THE BASEMENT WITH KEYS never further investigated her father or the basement after his sporadic response. The boyfriend who has talked to the sister and the film seemed like it was pushing towards a team up to investigate the house but it goes nowhere just like everything in the film. The argument scene between the sister mother and father have no progression even though it hinted towards it. With the mother threatening a PI the sister questioning if the dad did something his defensive responses. HOW DOES NO ONE CATCH THESE RED FLAGS!Then the actual girl in the basement has no uphill battle and tries to fight back once. Even when theres a hole in the ceiling she just forgets about it. Like it goes from thinking ""Hey maybe she make a plan to escape or fight back."" because thats where the momentum was going...then it flashes forward a year. Thats the pace of this movie.The tone overall is just edgy triggering and over the top. The rape scenes are so sudden and jarring going for a trigger factor and not from something rooted in his past or something in his arc. There is no strong female character in our protagonist where we root for her. Give Dont Breathe for example. It ended up in a similar scenario where the blind man forced breeding on the female protagonist. But here theres a strong moment where he gets taken down and well for those who have seen that movie you know...he gets what he deserves. This film is missing something like that. A part showing the dad isnt an unstoppable force that he has a weakness.Even the ending when he gets caught was unsatisfying. He couldve at least been thrown down by the cop if he fought back. Show the audience the father getting what he deserves. His character is vile and evil (while unknown where this rooted from)There is very little redeemable moments from this movie besides the fact of spreading awareness in sexual assault which is why this gets 1 star for me.I recommend watching The Stepfather (1987 version is best) or Dont Breathe then this mess of a film.",1.0,573

And what the excuse: fear of mice) !!!For bloody 20 years of AGONY the girl did not get sick even once  she did not lose one of her teeth she did not suffer from pain and cramps due to sleeping on the cold floor she didnt lose the shine of her beautiful skin!  she did not lose her hairstyle! and she even did not lose the shape of her body (Never) even though she has been pregnant four times in row!!!!When they went out the basement after 20 years (What a surprise) all of them in excellent physical and mental health they went out into the sun as if nothing had happened .. Children infront of the lake play with each other normally.Did the director think that this is a natural scene of two children who didnt see the sun from the moment of their birth until the ages of 16 and 18 years?And the young man (the girls boyfriend) !!! Oh my GodWhat is this nonsense? !!! A 38 years old man who once loved a girl in his teen when he was 18 years old he did not marry! He didnt get another girlfriend! He did not travel go to university or live his life like any normal young man .. No simply he had not seen her for 20 years ... He is still waiting for her!

Ed-Shullivan, This is the type of story that whack-a-doodles get their insane ideas from just like Josef Fritzl did,"This may be pure fiction but more likely loosely based on Austrias Josef Fritzl who in 1984 admitted that he imprisoned his own 18 year old daughter Elisabeth in the family home basement and where Josef repeatedly raped her to which seven (7) children were born out of his incest with daughter Elisabeth. Elisabeth gave birth to seven children during her twenty four (24) years of captivity. I fear that it is stories such as this that create copycat monsters who make reality out of fiction.There is another similar themed film made in 2015 titled simply ""Room"" in which actress Brie Lawson won her Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. This film starred Stefanie Scott as Sara the imprisoned daughter of Don played to perfection by Judd Nelson For a made for TV film which are usually produced on a shoe string budget there was little creativity with the wardrobe and makeup and as such the twenty (20) year elapsed time while Sara was imprisoned with two of her three children did not result in her or her children showing the expected tired aging of living without sunlight and minimal nutrition and/or professional healthcare. In fact her third and youngest child born named Christofer who was allowed to live upstairs with his grandparents looked as if he was several years older than his own older imprisoned brother Michael.For people who are fearful of imprisonment I would not suggest you watch the film as actress Stefanie Scott did a relatively realistic job of convincing us that she was imprisoned over twenty years in the basement. But maybe with most of the film which appeared on screen occurred in the basement set maybe actress Stefanie Scott was actually going a bit stir crazy being stuck in a confined space without sunlight over most of the films scenes she appears in.I give this made for TV film a decent 6 out of 10 rating for the more than adequate performances of Judd Nelson Stefanie Scott and Joely Fisher. But on a personal note it would be my choice that these types of films were never allowed to be viewed to ensure the worlds whack-a-doodles did not have any inspiration to make their illegal and unrealistic fantasies come true.",6.0,581
anushkalovell, A REMINDER OF A DISGUSTING PATHETIC WORLD WE LIVE IN,It takes a lot of strength to watch a movie like this.. and it is a shocking reminder of the cruel pathetic perverted and disgustingly despicable world we live in.. It is hard to imagine a young girl gave birth on her own to 4 children and they lived in a basement for 20 yrs without going insane.. not sure how much the movie retells the real story of the. Fritzl case.. However they could have made the girl age - she went down there at 18 and came back at 38 and she didnt look a day older.. a little far fetched in terms of characters shown for the movie.. the acting on the most part was good but its hard to wrap ones head around such a.case.,7.0,582
tocanepauli, This film scared me!,I found this film compelling but so disturbing! The worst part was when she was first locked in - what that must have felt like! I was not aware of this story but to think it is true fills me with pure dread. Very well acted and portrayed. Pure evil does exist........,8.0,583
Drogan-Hex, Unpleasant,Directing: Elisabeth Röhm did a great job with this small budget movie and delivered the message she intended to send although there were many flaws and mistakes but the message did go through as intended.Production: Again this is a low budget movie and have as a result some limitations that were obvious. I genuinely believe that with some extra effort this would have been an amazing theatrical piece but sadly its not. Nevertheless they did a great job.Script: Although the movie is classified as Crime and Thriller the story is based on the real-life events of Elisabeth Fritzl and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father Josef. Even though the story is well documented it took 3 writers to write it and did so horribly. The script is a major setback imo.Acting: Stefanie Scott did great and so did Judd Nelson whom I did not even recognize at first. Almost all did a good job but what disappointed me the most was that the horribly written script that clearly showed in their performance.Cinema and sound: To be honest while watching neither the music nor the camera work bothered me. They did a better job than I expected.Conclusion: These kinds of stories need to have a weigh and a certain play on emotions as well as balance of power. On one hand would be the abusive power the dad holds against the daughter and her own power to withstand and live through it. Sadly the latter was not as evident.I give Girl in the Basement a rating of 5/10.,5.0,584
Edvis-1997, 8,Wow. That was the best movie of 2021 that Ive seen so far. Acting was on point it was convincing theyve managed to have strong personalities. The plot was disturbing I cant remember when the last time Ive seen such film. I love horror movies and this one is approved by me. Ive really enjoy it it just shows how your life can be in someone else hands just in the blink of an eye. The fact that this movie is bad on some real story just add value to it.

The documentary on 60 minutes and others who gave account on this crime was even more horrifying then the movie showed. I tell you there are some evil demonic people in this world. This thing was an absolute monster I wont even call him a dad or a father definitely not a man hes a MONSTER!!,5.0,587

alicheaito, Good story. Ok film,I enjoyed watching it. Though I thought there are some big writing flows like the mental and cultural state of the children that never got out of the prison; they seemed nearly like any other child. Additionally I saw no depth in any of the characters nor did they seem to develop over the course of 20 years. It all seemed very unrealistic. Cinematography was ok. They could have done more work to convey the story. Acting not bad but definitely could be betterOverall I would never not recommend nor dismiss it.,6.0,589

jackgdemoss, My first time rating a Lifetime movie,I knew something was off the moment our main antagonist delivered his first line of dialogue. He was such an atrociously bad actor throughout the entire film that it genuinely felt like a school project at times. It wasnt until the first cut to black during a tense moment that I realized this is a Lifetime made for TV type movie. With that taken into consideration it held my attention well enough. What trumps even the poor acting and cinematography was the method of story telling. They attempt the classic move where they show a scene from near he end of the movie and then jump back 20 years earlier slowly building back up to that moment to continue from it. The problem is that this particular scene shows us that any attempt at escape we see throughout the first hour will be unsuccessful killing any tension and momentum. This was based off the harrowing real story of Elisabeth Fritzl and more justice could have been done with it in the film realm.,4.0,595

nurulhussain_marx, Movie that previews hidden reality out there,I came across this movie by a suggestion made from random Facebook friends and thank God I watched till the end. This movie is made with balance especially in the aspect of how the evil dad captured her and did things to her. They didnt go overwhelm about it; but audience got the idea about how the daughter is being treated. The story entails about how mean a father could be just because of his own wrecking marriage as it was found that his wife has an affair too; which has consequently lead him to see his daughter as an object for revenge; with her rage attitude. To me mr Director has successfully delivered his best as he was able to keep the story precise and concise from beginning till end. No dragging here and there. Well done. Especially the main character.,10.0,598

burlesonjesse5, VIEWS ON FILM review of Girl in the Basement,"Girl in the Basement is my latest write-up. Its a brutal experience not a movie and I dont think I could sit through it again. That doesnt mean its not recommendable.So yeah ""Basement"" is a Lifetime film on anabolic steroids. It makes other Lifetime endeavors feel like childs play in comparison. The despicable antagonist in ""Basement"" is played by Judd Nelson. If you thought you hated his John Bender in The Breakfast Club you aint seen nothing yet.Girl in the Basement is like 2015s Room bucked up about ten notches. And if youre easily upset and/or wholly traumatized you might wanna stay clear of ""Basements"" tormented 88-minute running time.The director of ""Basement"" is actress turned rookie helmer Elisabeth Rohm (she makes a cameo too). Rohms debut is impressive as she uses two or three locations and creates a level of claustrophobia and pseudo Stockholm syndrome. Heck ""Basement"" contains the type of cinematic family dysfunction that would make Maury Povich eat his heart out.Based loosely on a true story and spanning about twenty years Girl in the Basement is about a father (Judd Nelson as Don) who holds his youngest daughter captive in his downstairs abode. He abuses her rapes her and in disturbing fashion she ends up mothering three of his children (with one added miscarriage brought on by brute violence).In retrospect I was almost reluctant to review Girl in the Basement because well the putrid subject matter punched me in the gut once too often. However the somewhat happy ending and eventual rendering of the outside world was enough to suffice. ""Basement"" is a Lifetime pic that other Lifetime pics couldnt touch with a stick. It will affect you terribly and make you realize that todays environment although hard up might not be so hard after all.",8.0,601

BritneyPWrites, An effective-enough telling of a true-life tragedy,Girl in the Basement is a win for modern Lifetime -- timely reasonably well acted and presented dark but not devoid of hope. It is the fictionalized account of the 24-year ordeal Elisabeth Fritzl endured at the hands of her abusive father.In a few words this adaptation is a story of stolen innocence and youth fortitude and survival. At least thats how I saw it.Though my own childhood experience with my father was *nowhere near* as harrowing as what is depicted here as someone who contends with PTSD I gravitate toward titles like this to challenge and if necessary buttress my recovering mind and though Girl in the Basement made for a deeply difficult watch I actually felt more empowered than not by the end.This girl -- this woman this mother -- fought to stay alive fought for her children and she survived. Maybe its strange to feel proud of someone you dont know and will never meet but...maybe its not. *Thats* what I took away from this as a viewer.Above all the film will make you feel. Disgust anger frustration trepidation sympathy curiosity bewilderment admiration for the character based on Fritzl herself (portrayed proficiently by Stefanie Scott) -- you wont walk away from this without having an opinion on it and in that respect the work works.Its not a perfect or even great telling by any means but the film will also make you think. It raises awareness -- inspires people to become more familiar with Elisabeth Fritzls story and by extension the idea of exploring all options when a person goes missing or isnt directly heard from in years. It contributes to conversations on sexual abuse and the devaluation of human life particularly in regard to women and the efforts made to control them. It reinforces the collective need to get these topics out in the open so we can work on preventing/protecting each other from like tragedies.In sum this movie will make you think and feel if you let it. Will you let it?Speaking as a trauma survivor whos seen this to trauma survivors who havent: It may very well be too much at times but I would still recommend giving it a try if youre interested in doing so or fast-forwarding/leaving during certain parts. Please set your own pace. But know:You can get through this.WE can get through this.,6.0,607

Madison Russell a fan of Bernies podcast enlists her friend Josh to investigate Godzillas attacks. Apex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind a Hollow Earth theorist to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth the homeworld of the Titans.

He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field.Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. Nathan Ilene and an Apex team led by Walters daughter Maia board a modified barge escorted by the U. S. Navy that carries a sedated and restrained Kong.

mikebellman-497-799488," Rain, roars and retro lights","Every human is so one dimensional and implausible that I cant even begin to understand the nature of this film. Where did eco-terrorist Alan Jonah go to? He took the Ghidorah skull from the last movie and then suddenly someone else gets it? Why is Dr Mark Russel even in this film? He does literally nothing in three different parts of the planet. Why does Ilene Andrews call after Jia when she runs off? Shes DEAF! Why is Maya Simmons in this movie? Shes the disposable daughter of the mad genius who displays no talent at all and dies off camera.Lets ignore the sheer human deaths in the thousands in every major act. Yet in every film to date these awful parents allow their children to interact with titans. Usually when its raining. Lets forget that children are able to walk inside not one not two but three highly sophisticated and guarded locations without interference. Plus they hitch a ride into some kind of mag-lev container which is transporting eggs we never hear about again and has a display in MPH even though its an Hong Kong craft. The only thing this film does better than Godzilla: King of the monsters is theres fewer scenes with rain. But theres still a ton of rain. Why? I dont know.Why did they need Kong to ""lead"" them into hollow earth. They already had a reinforced cave leading to it. Kong didnt do anything except fall through a wormhole unscathed. While the humans needed three anti-gravity spaceships to travel there. And of course the debunked defamed author Nathan Lind is somehow also a pilot who once safely back home decides to stay airborne to watch the Titans battle it out instead of getting far away like a sane person might do. And this magical author/pilot found the single switch on the control panel which turns it into an ape defibrillator. And sure chain up a titan on a transport boat but lets rig up a single lever to let him go. Hey heres an idea lets upload the essence of a dead hydra skull brain into a robots energy source.Lets talk about how every light source in the facilities crafts and bases plus all the buildings are lit in neon trim like they looted the set of TRON:legacy. How come Apex needed this mysterious energy source from Hollow Earth and when they take a small sample they only thing they needed was math to recreate it? Did you know all you need to interrupt a satellite uplink into an unguarded control room is a half flask of booze poured on the cooling fan? I didnt but the randomly Australian comic relief did.Theres hardly a hint of blood from either monster even though Godzilla rakes its claws deep into Kongs flesh multiple times and both are dragged face-first into glass and steel buildings. Kong is also a master axe-man who uses the blade as a tool a key and a shield.I could go on and on about this film but I am exhausted.

jaapeelman, Great special effects with unbelievable stupid storyline,The special effects in this movie are great and Kong looks really alive.But my God what an unbelievable stupid storyline in which really nothing makes sense.In a movie like this you know that realism is far away but this movie is nr 1 in unrealism.For instance going down in mother earth and the gravity reverses (WTF?) in a second crushing evrything going through. But Kong has no problem with it and the same for the humans in some kind of aircraft: ask a fighter-pilot what it feels like to pull 3G or more. And try to do it without a pressure-suit.....And than a whole world in the core of the earth?Please only make a dumb movie about Godzilla but not something stupid like this movie with Godzilla and Kong together.The great special effects saved the movie a little bit and thats why I rated it a 5 but that is in fact to much....Anyone giving it more that six stars should have a brain-examination.....,5.0,620
MrDHWong, Delivers exactly what it says on the poster - a pair of iconic monsters duking it out in the most epic way possible ...and very little else,"""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is the fourth film in Legendary Pictures ""MonsterVerse"" and the fourth Godzilla film produced in the west. Starring Millie Bobby Brown Julian Dennison and Alexander Skarsgård it delivers exactly what it says on the poster - a pair of iconic monsters duking it out in the most epic way possible ...and very little else.Sometime after the events of ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" the giant ape Kong is being kept under surveillance inside a large simulated habitat forming a bond with a deaf girl who communicates with him through sign language. One day Godzilla attacks a city in Florida for seemingly no reason and this sparks an international debate over whether or not these huge monsters are a threat to humanitys future. A team of experts soon deduce that Godzilla was actually tracking Kongs energy signal and decide to transport him somewhere secret in an effort to prevent the two of them from fighting each other and causing even more collateral damage.When it comes to giant monster movies you cant go too wrong with the ones featuring the undisputed king of the monsters himself - Godzilla. Since 1954 this giant reptilian has been stomping his way through cities battling various monsters of similar size with his brute strength and trademark atomic breath. Every time I hear Godzillas signature roar it gives me chills like the first time hearing a lightsaber turning on in ""Star Wars"" or the DeLorean from ""Back to the Future"" reaching 88 miles per hour. Likewise the enormous gorilla Kong has also had his fair share of time in the spotlight debuting all the way back in 1933 in the classic film ""King Kong"". With this in mind it seems fitting that these two iconic titans of east and west should face off against each other at some point having previously done so in 1962s ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"". Now in 2021 we have a brand new reimagining of such a rivalry complete with better special effects and destruction galore. Theres something so mindlessly satisfying in seeing giant monsters beating the hell out of each other while leaving heavy destruction in their wake. I guess its all just part of the entertainment value we can take away knowing its all in good fun and that we can be thankful such colossal creatures dont exist in real life. However if you are expecting to be treated to anything else beyond this you will be greatly disappointed. Regardless if fighting monsters and gratuitous demolition of skyscrapers is what you crave then this movie certainly delivers.In addition to this the film also touches on the mythology of these strange beasts (known as ""Kaiju"" in Japanese) with particular focus placed on Kong and his origins. Im no expert on Kaiju lore or anything like that but I did enjoy that we got to see how these towering figures arent evil beings with a lust for destroying everything but rather neutral parties trying to establish their place at the top of the monster food chain. Of course the level of neutrality varies for each of the two with Kong perhaps being ""True Neutral"" and Godzilla being ""Chaotic Neutral"". For example Kong is seen attempting to live peacefully on Skull Island under the pretense that he is in charge and nothing else can take that away from him. Later on when Godzilla arrives to challenge this notion an all out brawl ensues much like how predator animals like big cats would fight one another to establish dominance. We are informed it has been like this for thousands of years and that human civilisation has only popped up recently just being on the brink of learning how to co-exist among all this ongoing conflict.Theres not much to say about the films human characters as they are only there to help move the small remnants of the plot along. Most of them were either generic military personnel marked for death or scientific minds trying to make sense of all this madness. I suppose Millie Bobby Brown was the only actor in the film with some dimension to her as anyone who saw 2019s ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" will recall her character and her importance in that story. I did also like the films scenes with the deaf girl talking to Kong via sign language as this reminded me of the famous gorilla Koko who was taught how to communicate with her trainers through similar means. In spite of all this by the end of the movie I couldnt recall a single name of anybody other than the titular monsters remembering them by the actors real names instead of their characters. At the same time though it didnt really matter because at the end of the day we dont pay to see a giant monster movie for the human characters for the same reason we dont go to McDonalds to order a filet mignon. Godzilla and Kongs names are in the films title and it should be obvious by now that they are the real stars here not the humans.As far as giant monster movies go ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" does a serviceable job at entertaining us with frequent action and great special effects. Its mind numbingly simplistic but I wouldnt expect anything less. At this stage it is unknown if there will be any more films in this ""MonsterVerse"" but I do see potential in the franchise continuing for as long as the demand is there. Since there are still plenty of threatening monsters out there to be dealt with I remain hopeful.I rate it 6.5/10",7.0,621

Has a terrible plot,I didnt like the movie.Leaving aside the special effects the plot is terribly bad far-fetched and very difficult for children to understand.Bring two parallel stories 1 the stories of humans seeking conspiracies and 2 the story of kong and GodzillaIt is unnecessary the parts of the conspiracy seekers could well be cut and the movie would still stand and even improve a lot.Why such a far-fetched argument?But my God what the hell is the Hollow Earth?It is an abuse of science fiction to raise another Earth within the earth with a different gravity etc etc it is too much! Or are they very high?But why the hell are they going to the hollow earth?,1.0,624
ppepio, Ridiculous,Absolutely nothing about this makes sense. From the fact that the girl kind of had to start teaching sign language to Kong by the time she was 1 week old to the hollow earth ridiculous theory of a guy that wrote a book nobody bought but suddenly caught the eye of a Mexican gazillionaire with Mexican accent but an Amrican name that took a couple of months to build the technology that must have taken at least 15 years to design test and build. Nothing makes any sense whatsoever. Yes the special effects and sound might be good but nothing else does.,1.0,625
dr-cheyno, Pretty much what you would expect,40 minutes of awesome battle scenes. 120+ minutes of annoying kids and a garbage plot.Token child actor under 10 getting more screen time than Godzilla or Kong. (Tick)Boring/stupid plot (Tick) Little girl teaching Kong sign language..PLEASE!! Some of us have an IQ over 60. Stop assuming the audiences is going to be full of idiots.Horrible acting (Tick) Name one decent performance in this movie i dare you to find one.Worth the watch but honestly you could basically just skip straight to the battle scenes and it will make NO difference plot wise. You will be missing absolutely nothing.If you guys just listened to the reviews the results would be amazing. Go back to the Godzilla/Kong roots. Not this modern Hollywood crap thats tailored for the mentally imapired.,6.0,626

dasa108, Giant crap,This is the clearest evidence of how Hollywood can destroy great movie icons. Unable to make a decent film about Godzilla they decided to destroy the two great cinema monsters with the bonus that Mechagodzillas fantastic robot is reduced to a cockscrew. If I pay a ticket to see the film I want the story to be honored: Godzilla has features that we hope to see film after film. I dont ask for much. But the untalented people who made the film came up with the idea that it was better not to play Godzillas music. I thought of Star Wars without it´s iconic music. Its the same. An aberration. On the other hand the humanization of King Kong is unbearable. Uncomfortable worried it makes it nauseating to see the great King Kong turned smart gorilla who can communicate with his little friend. Since when did King Kong stop liking blondes? The humans who star in the plot are also unbearable. The boy the particular reason I hated Deadpool 2 now achieved the impossible: that he hated American movies about monsters with an inclusive cast. Of the others only one sentence: I wanted them all dead in the first frame. Everyone their parents and their grandparents. I wanted everything to explode in the film and in the final fight they would wipe out humanity starting especially with those involved with the production of this slug this crap this cinematographic insult. Finally: Godzilla has no neck and has a microcephalic head. I dont know who came up with it that this is how the king of monsters should look. Godzilla for that anatomy couldnt even look to the side without having to rotate the body. King Kong using weapons is as if it were an extension of past films with apes conquering the world inaugurated by Charlton Heston. No Hollywood dont do it anymore. Stop doing garbage. Stop insulting our intelligence and pockets. Stay away from this movie at all costs well-shot fights arent worth everything behind and around them. If you want to watch a decent movie just watch the ones made in Japan or Pacific Rim.,1.0,628

jp_91, A waste of time!,"""Godzilla vs. Kong"" is a weak film with a bad script. Two of the most important monsters in the film history together in a movie some good things and a lot of problems. The good things are the beautiful visuals correct performances an amazing music score tribute scenes to the original ""King Kong"" film and to the ""Gojira"" franchise and the best point is that this film is saving movie theaters around the world from bankruptcy after the current COVID-19 pandemic but it is not enough. The bad points are the fake special effects and an awful scrift full of inconsistencies and stupid jokes it is like an episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" mixed with a telenovela episode and an episode of ""Thundercats"" this may be interesting but in this production is a failure. A really bad film!",2.0,632
davidmalaimo, waste of time,"I was pretty stoked for this movie after seeing the trailer. Figured itd be a solid arthouse horror picture a la A24 type deal. This is coming from a guy who mostly prefers the B stuff but i enjoy me a good arthouse indie flick now and again.But gee the two main characters were so flat and boring. Like they couldnt add banter? Find interesting things to talk about while traveling through the woods. I miss the days in horror and maybe this still happens from time to time where characters have these very interesting attributes. An example in del toros chronos ron pearlmans character was obsessed with the size of his nose and getting a nose job. It was such an interesting tid bit. In this film there was none of that. The characters just flatly said things that were part of the plot. No banter. No conversations. Just ""this is why im here"". ""this is what im doing"". ""why are you doing this?"" ""oh thats why"".Then a bunch of weird plot stuff indecision in what the movie is supposed to be. Wicked cool trippy cinematography type stuff that was completely ruined by the entire plot of the movie. A bad explanation about why everything is the way it is.Also the movie alludes to some kind of quarantine at the beginning. Not the one were in rn i dont believe. But i think the writer thought that this would give it an air of mystery and apocalyptic dread. I think a movie like Monster a sorta apocalyptic monster film that sorta followed a few people roaming through the forests did this concept well. In The Earth however did not. Just felt meaningless and pointless and was just an excuse for non-dialogue that thes indie filmmakers like so much.The last 20 minutes was kinda coool. But not worth what you put into it. I really wanted to walk out of this one.",4.0,633
jacobmhelberg, Good 1st half. Second half almost unwatchable.,Surprisingly enough I liked this movie up until the pair left Zacks camp. After that it turned into an absolute mess that had no idea what it was going for. The characters make stupid decisions and blindly trust people because they were pen pal lovers?To add on to the lack of story you are constantly bombarded with the most unpleasant strobe lighting and wonky sounds ever. It got to the point where I needed to squint in the theater so my eyes werent flashing.Also Im fine with movies that have vague endings but oh my God this did nothing to wrap up their horrible journey in the forest. Alma seems possessed and suddenly knows how to leave... wonder where she got that information from? (Oh yeah... the LSD monster probably showed her and we were supposed to understand whatever those visuals were).,4.0,634
lillysilva-97518, disappointing movie,This movie kinda sucked. A lot of unnecessary flashing lights which does tie into the plot but it got way too much at times. Hardly even a horror movie more like a thriller. The plot was also hard to follow along with during the second half of the movie. The flashing lights get VERY intense and theres about 30+ minutes of it during the entire movie i left the theatre with a headache. The idea was good just the execution was mediocre:/ (although i need to add the sound design was amazing and fit perfectly for each scene),4.0,635
Dan_Perazzo, Close to the worst movie I have ever seen,Some decent cinematography and nice early build of suspense. Then it gets bizarre not necessarily bad in a horror film. Then it goes off the rails dumb as hell and tries its best to give you a damn seizure. Ending sucks nothing rewarding or redeeming here! Avoid this at all costs pretty sure this movie gave me a headache! The acting is decent but overall complete trash! Not worthy of a movie theater and I wouldnt even put my TV through that!!!,2.0,636
kyleherbertz, rubbish!,Complete garbage from beginning to end.

There is a warning at the beginning of the movie that says something likeIf you are photosensitive to strobe lights this movie contains scenes that might trigger an epileptic seizure. Ooohhhh scary! It turns out to be more like the Blair Witch movie-an effort is made to scare you but not much is actually there. Joel plays a scientist that is traveling into the woods to meet an old colleague of his Hayley who has not been heard from in quite a while. She was supposed to have been working on some kind of virus cure but thats not the case. Ellora is the park ranger leading Joel into the woods-he might get lost otherwise-when they run into Reece who appears to have been living in the woods for a little while himself and has his own agenda going on. The epileptic causing scenes are mostly strobe lights going off that Hayley has set up for her experiments-she also has loud speakers attached to trees but its just really loud noise.Its rated ""R"" for violence grisley images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.I would not buy this movie on DVD. I wouldnt rent it either. If you really have an interest in seeing it I would wait until its on basic cable tv.",3.0,648
seejackrunguitar-41487, Don't waste your time,The only way to enjoy this film is to take psychedelic drugs and imagine you are watching something else. The trailer was extremely deceptive. Its not scary. The characters are boring. The plot makes no sense. The dialogue is like listening to someone give a heartfelt speech at a karaoke night. And the ending is abrupt and extremely disappointing. Spent 50$ taking my wife out on a date to see this movie and I am surprised she didnt leave me on the spot. Please heed my advice and watch anything else.,1.0,649
baybaganz, A very well crafted horror film. Not for those seeking a traditional horror experience.,I had no idea what I was getting into coming in to this movie. My father brought me to see as he is a fan of the filmmakers other works. I must say I saw riveted throughout the whole experience. I never felt bored or felt like the film was meandering. The overall concept was fascinating and kept me intrigued and wanting to see what would come next. I dont want to give too much away with the story as I think its best to come in blind on this one as I did. My main complaint is with the ending. It felt very abrupt and I was scratching my head a little as I left the theatre. However I dont answers should always be handed to the viewer on a silver platter and Im sure the filmmaker wants the audience to contemplate the film afterwards which I definitely have been. It would have been nice to get a bit more pay off though. If you are a fan of films like Annihilation or The Witch I think this will be right up your ally. If you just want some traditional horror then you will most likely not enjoy this film. Ive seen many people give scathing reviews regarding this film and I just cant agree even with my problems with the way the story concludes. Very well crafted and original horror.,8.0,650

WankerReviews, creative but blah,I can appreciate when a movie is trying to be different but that didnt make me like the movie or story. The characters arent very likeable.

rgkarim, Does This Movie Belong In The Earth?,"LIKES:Good CinematographyMore UniqueCreepy AtmosphereGood ActingShorter Run TimeDISLIKES:Little BackstorySlow Pace At TimesThe Flashing Bulb Effects Are AnnoyingDisturbing At Time and not enjoyableTorture For Much Of The MovieAn Artistic Ambiguous Ending that lacked sustenanceThe Review:These movies can sometimes have some of the most unique camera work in the business and this movie lives to that trend. In The Earth dwells in the woods and the budget of this film seems to have made them think of the best ways to add creepy setting to the film. It succeeds well with the use of shadowy lenses obscure angle use of night time setting on cameras and multiple shots that help maximize the feeling of being alone in this odd situation. With the sound editing that goes with it the feeling of being isolated in the woods especially these woods helps assist with adding that creepy atmosphere that really is the scariest part of the movie for this writer. Its certainly a more unique approach to the scary story and the premise itself upon presentation is surprisingly different compared to the usual arsenal of demons specters and sources of terror that the horror genre has used for years. Thus those looking for the unique movie will get that aspect in the film especially that creepy atmosphere that gets under your skin. Outside of the cinematography the movie has many elements that add to the factor of skin crawling and wincing that these types of films can bring. The unknown mystery of the forest helps start things off the promise of hope and dismay lingering in the woods constantly fighting for balance really setting the stage for an anything can happen attitude. Once things heat up the movie starts to mess with the psyche of the audience as weird sounds start to emerge random events happening in the night and vague terminology and lore interweave to give an uncertainty that is uncomfortable but at the same time alluring. Yet the final layer that comes with it is the ""villains"" in this film whose actions and odd behaviors are really the most uncomfortable parts of the film. Without giving too much away what those in the woods are willing to do to fulfill the plan are quite disturbing and some of the scenes really made me cringe and scrunch in my seat at the horrors being unleashed.In regards to the acting the movie again gets props for another fine performance in this very vague role with characters whose layers are very limited in the grand scheme of this artistic movie. Joel Fry hits the central role well awkward hopeful and plays tired very well given all the states of mind his character was going to be required to play. While not the most spectacular role for Oscar winning he does not overact nor simplify the role and keeps the realism in check quite well. Ellora Torchia helps add a little more strength and diversity to the role bypassing the neutral tones of her counterpart and providing more of the emotional diversity he film needed. She definitely keeps the plot moving and acted as a stronger character for me to follow than the others who hit this role. As for Shearsmith and Squires they nail the awkward atmosphere quite well in both physical and nonphysical acting. The way they deliver their lines always conveys there is more than they are telling and just the mannerisms alone are enough to convince you there is more beneath the surface than you might expect.But thats where the good ends for me and the limitations start to arise for this off the path horror movie. For one thing the backstory is pretty lacking a small amount of snippets here and there built into casual conversation. The synopsis talking about the virus plaguing the world (sound familiar) is only a minor plot component and the expedition to find the cure is really more of a façade than anything else. Character backgrounds the true nature of the binding force even the inclusion of a few others characters are all diluted plot components that did little to impress me given the promise the film held. This may seem minor to some but it sort of affects the pacing of the film which despite a slow build up was very off kilter at times as the movie proceeded. Sometimes very slow and drawn out and other times moving at breakneck speed In The Earth fails to find its rhythm struggling to pick a plot to keep the show on the road and keep the suspense going.Instead the focus seemed to be on the presentation and effects of the force that lurked in the woods. One aspect was the flashing imagery/strobe light effects that this movie was all about portraying throughout most of the movie. Annoyingly bright white light flashes with obnoxious sounds fill many sequences in this film and can potentially cause headaches migraines and of course epileptic seizures. They did have the foresight to warn you but take it from this reviewer and really think about seeing this film if you have any of these effects as this effect is very favored. The other gimmick that comes in is the torture and not the kind like Saw with clever games of traps and survival but merely torture for the sake of enjoyment. This is not up my alley and though there was a semi plot component to it the conflicting duality of the antagonists with the vague plot components left little purpose for the detailed drawn out mayhem this film relished in. About 20-30 minutes of this film could have been edited out from this slow bout of torture and crushing of the human soul and spent on character development and plot development instead. Some will say this is a good artistic direction and to that I can nod some respect towards but at the cost of the other elements I cant say Im happy with the sacrifices made in the sake of artistic display. This is especially true with the ending which if you look at the picture for the poster... sort of gives things away sadly. Much like many choices in the movie the big ending went down the same obscure feeling that involved drawn out use of flashing lights some darker themes and few answers to the overall goal of this movie. Those who like the head scratching endings that make you think will again enjoy this but for those who like feeling mostly complete at the end of the film dont your hold breath on that element.The VERDICT:Overall the movie succeeds in blazing a new type of trail that defies the normal tread path of the genre. With an open to interpretation plot full of mystery and curiosity a creepy realistic setting cinematography that works and some legitimate acting are the foundations to anchor to during this rocky ride. Yet the artistic approach to making this film while impressive and unique is not the most entertaining or sensible use of time. The uneven pace makes the movie feel long and the drawn out scenes of torture inhumane tactics and more focus on the obscure flashing vs. The sensible. Without a plot to tie it together and make the whole thing sensible a lot of this artistic features did not seem needed when it could have led to much better storytelling which I like. Without the complete ending and failing to deliver on the potential this film had to offer this movie is definitely not the new edge thriller I had hoped. Thus recommendations for this film are low for a theater visit and not much more for a view at home especially given the flashing lights effects. Therefore my scores are:Horror: 4.0Movie Overall: 2.5-3.0.",4.0,656
VolYotenbane, A psychedelic ride for the senses,"There was so much I loved about this art haus horror film. I appreciated the plot and call-out to alchemy shamanism and the forest as a deity who is desperate to send a message to humans. The cinematography was beautiful and captured what can be described as the ""brain"" of nature with flashing synapses both ephemeral and eternal all at once combining cyclical nature with the man-made flashes of photography. I loved the air of mystery and dread behind it and the sound design certainly added to that. My critique is that the film felt a little drawn out; it could have been cut down. However I saw this at Sundance so it could have been a rough cut. With some tightening up this visceral and psychedelic slow-burn horror shows quite a bit of promise.",8.0,657

dnathanr1111, A modern folktale on acid.,This was....something. I have no clue what these people rating this a 1-4 are talking about. This was AMAZING.A modern folktale on the relationship with humans and nature and the fight to be harmonious when itll never happen.Words cannot explain how CRAZY this movie is. The editing the visuals but most of all the SOUND. The score and the sound effects in this are just next level. Half of the movie consists of some of the most insanely annoying yet most uncomfortable things youve ever heard. Theyre literally just frequencies and noises but after hearing them its just stuck in your head.The visuals...wow the visuals. 3 different scenes caused me to completely cringe and I NEVER cringe at body horror. Never have except for those 3 scenes. I have 0 clue how they caused it to be so realistic...so visceralAlso the editing and the psychedelic-inspired (obviously) make you feel like you took a handful of mushrooms (pun intended if youve seen the movie). Its utterly mesmerizingThe story is very interesting as youre dropped into basically the middle of a story. A pandemic is happening 2 researchers are missing a scientist and a park ranger are going to find them.Thats when Martin ends up where he is at the beginning of the movie. After that the sh!tshow begins.I almost thought Olivia was gonna be good ALMOST. As soon as I heard her and Zach were once together though I knew for a fact she was gonna be crazy as hell too.This movie shows no matter what side youre on scientific or not you can go mad with the search for answers.The amount of inspirations in this movie is a LOT.

andycapp-63845, An Utter Waste of Time!,This movie lacked character development compelling characters an interesting story a plot logical reasoning for characters actions and conflict resolution.

mjanelle-24974, Good and bad (And GOD?),Very much a mixed review. This was by far one of the most bizarre movies Ive seen in a while. Started slow and awkward like they were trying for some kind of sexual tension between the two main characters. But that pretty much fizzled. This was followed by several scenes of continued awkward conversation followed by senseless violence (why???). Followed by creepy violence weird kidnapping whatever. Then escape and rescue but into something maybe worse.So Im sorry. I didnt get it. The performances were actually very good. But he left the theater confused  disturbed (but not in an interesting way - like Inheritance). I didnt feel like I was better or more informed by spending this two hours with this movie. Id wait for free streaming.,5.0,663

tservo-38280, Boring and Torturous,I have seen a lot of bad movies in my day but none of them have ever been such trash that I felt the need to write a review. The first third of this movie is incredibly tedious and the protagonist is an unlikeable wimp; the costar is decent but she only stood out because the protagonist is utterly useless. The middle is slightly more interesting but not by much. The last of the movie is almost unwatchable and pure torture. They blare loud sounds and awful music that were ear rape then had a strobe light effect that nearly made me vomit and triggered a splitting headache (theres a special place in hell for the person who thought that effect was a good idea); this goes on and on until finally and thankfully this boring slog of a movie ends. Nothing at all happens and not a darn thing is learned. Save yourself 2 hours and a migraine and see something else I recommend the demon slayer movie - it was 10 out of 10 fantastic.,1.0,665
sweidman-28016, Unsettling,"""Can you feel him now? In the earth?""***To hook your attention me (Sawyer) a person who is rarely shook was kind of freak out by this movie***Hi! Its been over a week and I have not stopped thinking about In the Earth. As the world searches for a cure to a disastrous virus a scientist and park scout venture deep in the forest for a routine equipment run. Through the night their journey becomes a terrifying voyage through the heart of darkness the forest coming to life around them. Ben Wheatley is typically a hit or miss kind of director. Ive only seen Free Fire so I cant really expand upon this. In the Earth premiered at Sundance this year however we decided to skip it considering most peoples thoughts on Wheatleys movies. Many are considering this to be a return-to-form movie. And many are saying this is the worst movie theyve ever seen. After seeing this opening night I immediately went back to the theater the next day because it stuck with me so much and I needed answers. In the Earth will not be everybody and probably wont resonate with most but I found a lot to like with it. The premise is quite simple in setup. We get this eco-horror eerie feel and we know something bad is going to happen. Though Wheatley put out a list of movies that inspired it and Annihilation Midsommar and The Ritual (which I actually watched right after seeing this) werent included they all had to have been. They are similar in concept and style. For some the beginning will feel slow but I think it goes by pretty fast. Slowly it grows into something more terrifying. By the end everything breaks loose. It has one of those endings that is absolutely chaos to the point you dont know what to think of it. The whole time I was gripping the arms of my seat. Intensity works in its favor and Wheatley knows how to get to your core whether its through visuals or sound design.The small cast does a great job you cant deny that. Were with Martin (Joel Fry) and Alma (Ellora Torchia) for a significant amount of the runtime. If theyre attached to any horror projects in the future I would love to see them. Weve seen Torchia in Midsommar before and she proves to take acting to the next level. Shes by far my favorite part of the whole movie. Fun fact: In the Earth was conceived written and produced all during quarantine. They actually shot the movie over a course of 12 days (I believe) so when you see the final product its amazing to see what was all accomplished. There are a few technical aspects that couldve used some fine tuning. Two cameras were used during shooting. One of them has really nice quality and the other looks like it was shot on iPhone. Not very often are those shots used but its very noticeable and sort of distracting at times. Also a few times the editing didnt necessarily work and theres seconds of black screen when it couldve easily gone straight to the next shot. As story goes I like it. Some of the dialogue isnt as good as it could be but I can live with it. My biggest concern with the story is what it has to say. Wheatley has a message to be said about human and nature but its not clear enough to see what exactly he wants to say. And when it comes to the demonic nature of the story not much is clarified which is where some audiences didnt like it. Part of the reason I went to see it again was to figure out what was actually happening especially towards the end. I now know a little more than I did on first viewing but I still am not sure what actually happened. Id love for Wheatley or someone to digest everything so we can have some clarity to what it all means.Now you can learn why this freaked me out a bit. The movie is designed to make you feel disoriented. Before it starts theres a message on the screen explaining how theres a significant amount of flashing lights that could be a concern to those prone to epileptic episodes. I love the use of flashing lights because you get some amazing visuals but I thought I was going to have a seizure. Adding to this theres also a constant droning bass to make you feel uneasy. Part of the story has to do with the connection from humans to ecosystem using lights and bass. Plants do communicate through frequencies using their roots and thats how the score is built. Clint Mansell crafted an excellent score to make it feel both like a midnight movie and get you on edge. Back to the bass theres that and feedback thats extremely loud. Some moments I thought my eardrums were about to burst. The sound and flashing lights are so intense and effective that about half of the people in the theater (granted it was about 10 of us) left. The editing (not the bad stuff I mentioned before) for the ""horror"" scenes and especially the end are very fast cut and well edited to further this effect. I left the theater feeling like I was going to be sick. Rarely do you get this kind of experience with a movie. The story isnt that scary where most of my fear came from that. Its all with how it makes you feel. I saw this in a fancy theater with a bigger screen louder sound and all that jazz. Im not sure how you could watch this movie in your house on a TV. Really In the Earth is meant to be seen in a theater. Most theaters arent playing the movie solely because its an indie flick that most havent even heard of so the opportunity to view this how it should be is very limited. Can I recommend In the Earth? To that I would say it depends on the person. Its a very mixed bag and it all depends on your views of horror and how you handle those effects. I like In the Earth. Its a movie like no other and will constantly be in the back of my head.",7.0,666
HorrorFreak1997, A psychedelic assault on the senses.,"Ben Wheatleys ""In the Earth"" is to put it simply a psychedelic sensory overload. There are many moments In the film where the use of flashing lights unbearable sounds and flashing imagery takes over. For some this will detract from the experience but for others this will just add to the maddening effect of the movie. Almost like miniature nightmare segments that make you incredibly uncomfortable.In terms of plot we finally have a truly interesting pandemic setting! A deadly virus has its grip on humanity and a scientist goes into the forest in hopes to discover a way to communicate with nature. This scientist believes if she can communicate with nature she can discover a way for humans and nature to live peacefully as one. Therefore removing things like viruses from existence. But when her colleagues lose contact with her they send our two main characters into the woods to find her.Our two main characters trek through the woods and eventually stumble upon a man who claims to be able to hear the spirit of the woods. Talking to him. Telling him to do insane things.This man is of course a threat but our heroes escape him and find the scientist.The scientist is eventually revealed to be working with the madman to complete a ritual. In her mind its an experiment in his mind a ritual.. theyve both gone mad. But all throughout we see shots of mushrooms expelling a toxin into the air as well. And at the beginning of the film its mentioned that the forest is the home to a spirit.Is it really possible to communicate with nature through light and sound like the scientist believes? Is there really a spirit in those woods controlling the madman? Or is it the mushrooms causing everybody to go insane? Theres many ways to interpret the movie. I suppose either explanation could work individually or simultaneously.One thing that can definitely be said is that ""In The Earth"" is a cinema experience like no other. I cant see it having the same effect at home on your couch. Something about seeing it on the big screen the visuals were intense and the sounds even more intense.To me the movie is about humanitys relationship with nature. In a time where humanity has become as desperate as ever to what lengths will we go to to find meaning and answers. Do the answers we seek even exist? As the mushroom mist nearly engulfs the camp.. our characters agree to perform the ritual/experiment. Displaying humanitys desperation to understand and befriend nature. But the only answer we the audience are given is that humans and nature can never exist together in harmony. One will always destroy the other.10/10.",10.0,667

david_rudy_lee, Atmopsheric Return to Horror for Ben Wheatley,This was a movie that Ill be honest jumped on to my radar as something to see for this year thanks to Duncan from The Podcast Under the Stairs. Him and Mr. Watson did a season of Opera Omnia that covered the filmography of writer/director Ben Wheatley. Hes a director that I believe Ive only seen one of his films at this time but that one I really liked. For this I came in blind just knowing it was getting some buzz that it was horror and getting to see it in the theater. The synopsis is as the world searches for a cure to a disastrous virus a scientist and park scout venture deep in the forest for a routine equipment run.We start this movie off with someone with a sledgehammer breaking a rock. They are smashing it into tiny pieces and the reason for this they are creating a booby-trap. One of these placed in the ground and hidden with grass over it. We then shift over to Martin Lowery (Joel Fry) approaching a cabin. As the synopsis states there is a virus pandemic so they have precautions here. He has to be sanitized before he can enter. There are more tests and checking out his paperwork that is done by James (John Hollingworth) and Frank (Mark Monero).Once everything has checked out Martin then meets with Alma (Ellora Torchia). She is the park ranger that is going to take him out to the campsite where the experiment is being done. The two meet in a room where on the wall is an old hand drawn picture. There is an entity of the woods that has become folklore according to Alma. The people from the nearby village have reverence for it as it almost seems like a god of sorts. What he sees makes Martin uncomfortable.The next day the two of them set out. It is a 2 day hike to make the campsite. Things seem to be going good until theyre attacked in the middle of the night. They wake up to find the equipment Martin was bringing was taken. Their shoes are gone and most of their supplies. They continue on but are slowed when Martin steps on a stone that gashes his foot. Their fortunes seem to be looking up when they encounter Zach (Reece Shearsmith) who is living off the land. He takes them but living out here might have made him a bit crazy. They arent too far from the camp theyre going for and it becomes a nightmare as they try to survive this ordeal.That is where I want to leave my recap for this movie. Where I want to start is giving credit to Wheatley. He wrote and directed this movie all during this COVID pandemic. I think it is quite strategic in what he did here with the writing. He is establishing that it is taking place during a pandemic but having it out in the woods he isnt under the constraints there as you would setting it in a city. There is a limited cast which also helps. It also feels that he research Olivia Wendle (Hayley Squires) is doing out there might help with finding a cure.Taking the setting even farther I love the idea of the isolation that comes from putting us deep in the woods. Once they are out in the wilderness it would take too long to get back so most of the time theyre closer to their destination. There is the feeling that they might never be found on top of that. This all builds tension. Making things worse is that you have Zach who from the beginning we learn that theres something off about him. I dont want to put him down but at first we just think hes a hermit. These people tend to be a bit off due to lack of human interaction. There is more to him than that though. Wendle has a similar feel. For her though how long shes been out there mostly alone has she seeming to descend into madness. I think how far into the woods this takes place builds that feeling of dread in the movie.There is also the idea of this entity in the woods. The moment I heard that I really started to look for things in the background of shots. I have to give credit to the cinematography here. There are times where I think there could be something there but it is only for a frame before it disappears. This helps with the atmosphere for the movie for me. We get more about this potential entity from Wendle as well. I like what the reveal is here and there is an interesting idea brought forth that could explain this virus as well. It really makes you wonder if some of things happening later are really happening or we have madness induced by nature and/or isolation.I believe that is enough for the story without going into spoilers. Where I want to shift next then would be the acting. I was excited to see Fry as Ive seen him in other things. I think he does a really good job as Martin here. I feel bad for him though as a lot of bad things seem to happen to him. Shearsmith looks great as Zach and I love the character he plays here. Squires is solid as Wendle. The big thing here is that we dont get to meet her until late but once we do she does a great job in building the atmosphere as well as establishing more of the lore. Torchia is good as well as Alma and the rest of the cast rounds this out for what was needed.Ive already said a bit about the cinematography but Ill double down that this movie is shot beautifully. It does a great job at giving us nature shots that still give a creepy vibe. On top of that the editing with certain shots helps. We also get some strobe lights later in the movie that adds as well. Aside from that I think the effects we get in the movie are great. They are done practical and are quite brutal. I was cringing quite a few times.Then really the last thing that I wanted to go over would be the soundtrack. It is used masterfully here. The vibe that the music gives to some scenes we are seeing helps to make them feel creepy even when nothing is happening. We also get some great use of sound off screen like people yelling. The music that is used during the climax also adds on top of this as well.In conclusion I really dug the concept and the story of this movie. It is taking something that most people in the world are sick of dealing with in a pandemic but giving us a different look at it. I think the setting of the woods is great for the isolation that comes with it. The lore that is established and built on as the movie goes is great as well. I would say that the acting is really good across the board. The effects cinematography and the soundtrack all work as well to build the atmosphere that this movie needs. This is one that I plan to rewatch before the year ends to see where it falls. After this first viewing Im sitting on it as a good movie.,8.0,674
rfan-66633, Incredible,"Maybe the only way to see this film is by sitting in the parking lot reading all the bad reviews before going in. To prime you for the suckage.I was mesmerized by it. I found myself shazaming everything I could and listened to ""Hammer of the Witches"" on repeat on the ride home.Its a visual and auditory experience. See it in the theater.I think people hate this film because its not spelled out to you what is happening. Im not entirely sure that I understood it all but I think think got it and will see it again.What a ride. There is a scene where she is pulled out of the mist by her colleagues with a rope. She is crying hysterically and babbling. Ive never seen an actor get to the point that she did. In her wonderful performance there I got what she was trying to say.Beware there are a few disturbing images in the film of gore. But when wandering into that mist what the viewer experiences on the screen may be even more difficult to sit through. This film is an achievement.",8.0,675
bdpeterson-06310, Very disappointed...,Loud sounds and flashing lights do not make a movie good or scary...After the movie was over it took me about an hour to regain my sight fully because of all the excessive flashing lights that did nothing for the plot or the movie except give me a headache.,3.0,676

ricky_dry_county, The reviews here are brutal!,1) And the negative reviewers are spot on. I just happened to not mind the artsy vignettes LSD flashes and the overall vibe. The misty important thing was that unlike current films the characters werent annoying or spewing amateur political vitriol. The lead guy was abysmally low on testosterone throughout and the lead lady has to literally carry him around quite hilarious actually.2) Its low budget but is trying to reach higher than it is capable of. Certain story structures are lost amidst the obsession with ambience and audio (Did the weird forest couple plan this together? Not much is said about it),7.0,678
terrencepatrix, Creepy and bizarre...mostly confusing,Ill admit that by the end of this movie I had no idea what happened or what it was really even about. I figured I must have missed something important so I went and read the synopsis detailing the whole movie and nope I didnt miss anything it just didnt make much sense at the end.It did have a very creepy and surreal vibe to it at times its a very framed in movie with a small cast the camera work and quality is all adequate. It just never really came together as a coherent plot and ending so I was left baffled when it was over. I dont expect a movie to be spoon fed to me but it could have used more exposition to explain what the hell was really going on.I imagine there are people who might love this I am not one of them. Didnt hate it but I wouldnt recommend this to people expecting a horror movie its far more atmosphere and vibes than story.,4.0,679

shawthingproductions, Poor writing and dull,"The actors did a good job with what they had to work with but the problem is you just dont care about anyone on screen. Theres no banter between people nothing you can really relate to hardly any information given about them which makes them seem like ""real"" people and yes I appreciate the world is in turmoil but even so - human spirit should still remain even if it is buried under angst. The dialogue is just boring to listen to even if the actors are believable as ""real"" people having the conversation.Directing-wise its typical Ben Wheatley (which isnt necessarily a bad thing). Theres some gruesome moments in it which as an old school gore lover I enjoyed but I need more than that to keep me watching a film and more than fancy visuals too.Unfortunately I turned it off after 58 minutes because I couldnt stomach watching anymore when time is so short. I am already annoyed that I wasted the first 58 minutes on this.",3.0,685
Otkon," Yeah, it's atsmospheric. But it is not good.","It is slower than death and about half an hour too long.It is all over the place. Part Stalker part Misery part The Ritual.

Otherwise this was too trippy and vague to be anything other than a mess.",4.0,686
manuelasaez," Absolute rubbish, as the British would say.",First off let me say that the trailer was a huge disservice to this film. What it advertised was a horror movie of the purest form; man with an axe body horror perhaps pagan ritualism? It really sold the movie didnt it? So how did the final product end up being so damn boring?The movie starts out fine and although things are dreadfully slow it sets the scene for act 2. Thats where things really fall apart. The movie nosedives off a steep cliff and falls so heavily Im surprised focus groups didnt tear this movie to shreds when it was first screened.Who was this movie made for. Exactly? Fans of horror will be sorely disappointed as there is very little of it to be scared of. Body horror? Bits and pieces (no pun intended). Pagan ritualism? Yes but it factors very little into the overall film. Its just a mess of a movie that is saved by the great acting and the unnerving musical score and thats literally it. When the movie ended I rushed to scrub it from my memory with an actually good film.Its bad people. Just utterly horrid in almost all respects. It will test your patience and you will not come out of it better than you went into it. Movies like these are an obvious exercises in creative vanity; make a movie that you know most people are going to hate simply because you can and no one around you tells you just how bad it will ultimately be. Its also an instance where you know that if the critics love it you know for a fact its going to be garbage.A waste of time for this viewer.,3.0,687
kevin_robbins, This is definitely one of the better horror movies of 2021 so far,In the Earth (2021) is a recent release the Mrs. And I went and saw in theatres this past Friday. The storyline focuses on a scientist and a Rangers trip into the forest on a research expedition that goes terribly wrong. They find someone they hope can help them; but as we know in horror help isnt always what it appears to be. This movie is directed by Ben Wheatley (Kill List) and stars Joel Fry (Game of Thrones) Ellora Torchia (Les Cowboys) and Reece Shearsmith (High-Rise). The storyline for this at first felt a little like Blair Witch until the researchers run into the couple that live in the woods then this took a drastic turn for the interesting. I loved the scenes with the ax stitching the head bleeding special effect the hazmat suit the eye at the end and the main character walking with no shoes. The attention to detail was great like the quick flash of light when theyre smacked in the head. I also thought the lighting and cinematography was outstanding. This is definitely one of the better horror movies of 2021 so far and Id score this a 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.,8.0,688

philiprooke, Going down to the woods again,Strange film as there seems to be some interesting ideas lurking but they dont really get fleshed out - avatar like tree communication theories/green Man folklore? Yeah sounds good but not really enough of it why not call this side of things out more at the start? All that is given is a very quick sentence regards a finding.Did I miss it - what was the vital piece of equipment that got taken? Its this sort of thing that raises questions that never get answered.Also youve just had the stuffing kicked out of you in your sleep had your gear and shoes stolen but then immediately accept help from the only person within 30 miles whose feet happen to be the same size.The film just seems to be at times almost unrelated cuts stitched together which does take any tension out of it I reckon if this could have been addressed the film would be a much better experience as it is it is just an act of observing things happening and waiting for some kind of payoff.Final message is that nature wants to help us if we listen but on its terms not ours hence why the tech couldnt break through.,4.0,693
necromancer-mcgill, Interconnectivity.,Interconnectivity presented through a psilocybin induced fever dream of a movie. Definitely not for everyone (apparent through the one sided reviews) but those who know Ben Wheatley will know this going in.While not his greatest effort I think its a flawed but solid little folk horror. All the performances were fine (just fine) and the setting and hallucinatory scenes work well. Good atmosphere with a little cringey gore thrown in.Getting anything made like this during the pandemic mustve been hell so Im impressed. Just wish I could have seen it in a cinema because Ive got a feeling the sound design wouldve been an experience.6.3 from me.,6.0,694

parkerbcn, English Folk Horror,"A very recent take on one of Britains more successful subgenres the folk horror (that has given us important films from masterpieces like ""The Wicker Man"" to modern takes like ""Eden Lake"").

Its still recommended.",7.0,697

js-66130, FOREST FRIGHT,"A successful horror movie should be enthralling enough to suspend any rational reasoning because lets face it logic is seldom found in the genre. Sure sure theres usually a plausible mystery setting the table but soon enough the dining tablecloth is pulled out and all hell breaks loose.This is the sink or swim portion of the experience where audiences are either reeled in or lost to whatevers on Netflix. And though ""In The Earth"" has a lot of loose end batshit explaining to do it provides just the right amount of vibrant thrills for a passing grade.There are curveballs a plenty here to swing at which makes the developing tangly plotline tough to decipher but who cares theres a slinky temptation about the proceedings that just works. What appears to be a pandemic epic quickly turns into a scientific camping trip that is equal parts Dr. Moreau and Blair Witch. Spoiler: not fun.Science mixes with mythology wacky experiments are run relationships are strained tenting goes awry. Mother Earth as welcoming friend vengeful foe or perhaps just a vibrant backdrop dominates the screen in a rich tapestry of greens and reds unforgiving terrain and impenetrable fog. A feast for the eyes especially the throbbing pulsing sporing mushrooms. She breathes!As horror 101 would dictate we have the bewildered innocents hunted by the psychotic elements. Theres another worldly ""Deliverance"" desperation feel here as our reluctant couple scramble for survival in an ecosystem they cant seem to escape captured and tormented by a lunatic fringe on a crazy Pagan ritual bender.Joel Fry is especially well cast as the gangly stumbling helpless Martin who spends a good chunk of the adventure trying to avoid various foot problems. Not for the squeamish these podiatry sequences escalate to comical proportions. That is the sign of horror success: when a guffaw is elicited during what is otherwise considered a most unfortunate circumstance.Filmed economically with scalpel precision by Ben Wheatley ""In The Earth"" proves the power behind the less is more aesthetic especially when clever camera work is employed.The end may be a bit lacking and open ended for those who prefer proper paint by numbers closure but hell the throbbing ride alone is worth the ticket. Recommended unless over stimulation aurally and visually proves too disturbing. But then again this is not the genre for the weak. Buck up!hipCRANK.",8.0,706
budyll, 2 Stars just for the gore effects. AVOID LIKE FIRE!,So before the movie got released Ive read multiple articles about it. Ive even seen somebody writing in a review that its the best British horror in years. I dont know what the person writing that review taken before writing it but I want some as well.The movie seemed interesting for about 25 minutes then Ive watched the rest of it as Ive already started. I will never get the time Ive spent on watching it back.There was literally no plot in the movie whatsoever nothing made sense at all as if the director didnt have a clue what he wanted to make in the first place. Acting was also pretty bad. The only good thing about it were gore effects that were top-notch.There was some sort of a virus having its origin in some sort of a fungus so I thought that there will be some kind of people turned in to some kind of fungal-infected monsters this would make it far more interesting.Just avoid it if you can. Trust me youll not regret not watching it.,2.0,707

ToeCutterZero, Why so many BAD horror movies?,"Im not a fan of horror movies and this film demonstrates why. Despite the cool cover art theres NO science fiction in this film. They took elements from Alien Covenant The Happening Avatar even 2001 A Space Odyssey threw them into a blender and presented this stinking pile of trash as a horror film.I challenge anyone to watch and try to make sense of whatever happened during this nearly 2 hour film of people wandering through the forest wailing and screaming. Theres no story here its simply a ""people walk into forest and stuff happens"" kind of film. We hear about a virus pandemic but its never referred to outside of the first act. There is however a dump truck full of exposition as the third act begins almost as if its a completely different film?! Theres little gore and when there is the characters are miraculously healed and apparently feel zero pain. Thats one of the most irritating things about this film: People dont act like people. They are driven only by what the script requires.Id have surely passed on it had I known it was directed by Ben Wheatley. He seems to have put more effort into the end credits than he did the entire film. How he keeps finding funding is astonishing considering his past films which range from strange to downright ridiculous. File this one under the ridiculous category.All the theaters might as well stay closed if this is the swill we can look forward to.

lbsa71, Ben Wheatley back up on the horse,"If you were blown away by the multi-layered plot of ""Kill List"" enjoyed the surrealism of ""A field in England"" the dark humor of ""Sightseers"" and chime with the themes of ""Upstream Color"" and ""Beyond the Black Rainbow"" - rest assured this IS a movie for you. If those movies dont mean anything to you or if you have come to known the director by some of his more recent productions like High-Rise and Rebecca this will be a confusing and potentially disappointing ride. While this is not a pandemic-flick Ã  la Outbreak I consider it the truest even the only depiction of a pandemic-ridden world I have seen to date. The mundane and low key depictions of pandemic coping rituals are fuelling the core value proposition of the film as a dark horror fantasy about our biological mandate to make sense of it all even where there might be no sense to be made. Thank you for this movie Ben and glad youre back.",8.0,712
jeff-1571," pretty good, disturbing horror film. not the usual stuff.",I liked this. It was disturbing interesting and suspenseful. Great use of sound and visuals. I like a wide range of horror but usualy dont like ones critics do like hereditary and the witch both of which i thought were garbage and wastes of time. Also thought It was a silly waste of time. This was eerie creepy suspenseful and disturbing. Solid but not great.,8.0,713

Joel Fry tries so very hard and Reece Shearsmith does Reece Shearsmith however Hayley Squires is beyond bad like Ruby Rose bad.Did getting the budget for Meg 2: The Trench somehow blow his mind?

deedee_2000-985-341635, where is the love?,I watch a lot of horror movies. I love horror always have. So when i kept reading all these reviews about how horrible this movie was i almost backed out of watching it. Thank goodness i didnt.In The Earth was different a very thoughtful well-done exercise. It sets an atmosphere of dread and builds on it. The movie opens as the world has seen a pandemic (familiar huh) and scientists are in search of a cure. Just a hint this has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A red herring. Then we are emerged in a folkloric tale of environmental horror. Granted i wasnt overly fond of the flashing lights but i understood the purpose they served in the plot and they didnt last that long.I have to be honest. I havent seen this much hatred for a movie since Midsommar and In The Earth did remind me of it. Dont get me wrong In The Earth is no Midsommar. However it does evoke that same sense of isolation and otherworldliness that Midsommar was so wonderful with.I gave In The Earth 6 stars. I wouldve given it more but i didnt care for the ending. Couldve been more fleshed out but all in all a good viewing experience :),6.0,715
themirsinho, Nothing like the trailer,Oh my this was the sickest movie I have ever watched. By sick I mean gruesome brutal and delirious.

I wouldnt be surprised to see it getting banned in some countries. This is a new kind of horror.,8.0,716

JorritM," the movie is fine, but the seizure inducing flashes are not",In the earth starts off a bit slow but its generally atmospheric and creepy. The first half has some good gore as well. The second half doesnt work as well but would still be watchable if it werent for the relentless visual flashes. Worst is there is no seizure warning either so I suppose I was just lucky Im not susceptible to flash induced epilepsy... All in all the movie was a bit disappointing. It had some interesting ideas but the execution was sadly lacking. Ill recommend it if you like flashes.,6.0,718

Its denouement will likely make most go ""Huh?"". Kudos to the technical team for making a forest bristle with ominous imagery and the effective score are standouts but unfortunately theres not enough to make this ecological horror movie a good one despite what most critics would have you believe.",6.0,719

foxypoo," Some parts I adored, other parts... not so much.","I really enjoyed A Field in England its a very experimental movie and in my opinion its one of the most underrated art films ever made. So naturally I was excited for this film. So how is it? Well Im not so sure if Im being completely honest.First of all I love the concept. I think its interesting and theres many avenues to go down. Second most of the acting is great... yes I said MOST. As expected Reece Shearsmith was fantastic and I wish I see him more in movies. Whenever he was on screen I was having an absolute blast. I think the lore side of the ""creature"" is really interesting but Ill get to the later. This movie is very well shot and the sound design is pretty great.Heres what I didnt like... I dont like Alma. Shes an annoying and boring character and I dont understand why shes even in the movie. Martin is an interesting enough character. I hated the dialogue at some points. There were a lot of times where I rolled my eyes because of how poorly written it was. Like I side I enjoyed the lore and worship part of the creature but the science aspect was boooooooooooring. I dont understand the point of Olivia at all. It would be wayyy more affective if Martin goes out to find Olivia and turns out Zach killed her. Not only that it would make more sense. And my biggest complaint with this movie is the lack of ambiguity. One of the reasons why I love A Field in England so much is because of how ambiguous and interpretive it is. And theres none of that here. Every bit of ambiguity is explained away. Its really obnoxious when you have an interesting and cool story but you explain every bit of interpretation you could have. This couldve been a story about Martin coming to terms with death but instead its about Alma killing a hobo. Its laaaaaame.Ben Wheatley is just trying to create a more digestible version of A Field in England but obviously it wasnt as affective as he wanted it to be. I hope Ben Wheatley will try and experiment with weird ideas again because this was a disappointment. Like I said there were moments that I loved but if anything those moments just confirmed why I love A Field in England. Anyway check this out if you want. Im giving it a 5/10.",5.0,722

calvinc1203, READ THE MOVIE TITLE!!,I havent written a review in awhile but felt compelled to do so because numerous reviews complaining about the movie as some sort of failed Fred Hampton biopic...The movie is titled JUDAS and the Black Messiah in which we should all be able to discern whos whom and understand why the movie isnt just about Fred Hampton so all of you with your fake woke-ness can stop talking about how shallow this movie is or how they didnt do enough and then counterintuitively discredit this accomplishment of a film about an important part of the U.S. history!,8.0,724
RinoBortone91, MASTERFUL FILMMAKING CARRING A DEVASTATING REALITY,"An electrifying and spectacular film that through the strength and magic of cinema denounces the abuses of people who at the time fought for their people and who unfortunately continue to do so not only establishing itself as one of the best films ever but managing to be the bearer of profound and devastating messages. The film through the telling of the story manages to shine and to be a real manifesto for the struggle of men who have done everything possible to say ""I am a human and I have a value"" in this case a community of black people who have suffered injustices and abuses without a valid reason. Judas and the Black Messiah is directed by Shaka King with extreme intelligence and tact with creativity and honesty; excellent choice of the cinematography and music that enhance the scenes and emotions of the brilliant cast (including Jesse Plemons always a pleasure to see him acting) but above all the impeccable and perfect LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya who lead the film with commitment honesty and dedication once again managing to establish themselves among the best actors of contemporary cinema not only increasing the value of the film but creating a real acting masterclass. Judas and the Black Messiah is rich in elements that blend between reality and cinema but in this case is nothing more than a single and well-defined world to be taken as an example and therefore as a purpose to follow as well as the characters of the true story tried to do.",9.0,725
ellagilbert-23101, relevant,This movie was quite well made. I have read about Fred Hampton before but the absolute terror of the FBI upon his life was really made clear by this film. Daniel Kaluuya emulated the necessary leadership and charisma to portray Hampton. My only issue with his casting is that he is in his thirties while Fred Hampton died at age 21. I think this is really crucial to the story- his assassination at such a young age is not a minor detail. I do appreciate that Akua Njeri (known at the time of the film as Deborah Johnson) and Fred Hampton Jr. were consulted for this film and I think that is clear. While Bill ONeal takes the forefront as a double agent Fred Hamptons character is still highlighted and preserved. The ending was absolutely devastating particularly the choice to include footage of the real Bill ONeal. I think this film launches an important conversation about being complicit vs. actively harming someone especially in the context of the Black Power movement. I also think its important for people to learn about the FBIs assassination of Black Panthers something which isnt typically taught in history classes.,8.0,726
cliftonofun, Universal and unique,"When I saw ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" less than a year ago I commented that there was likely a more interesting movie to be made about Fred Hampton. Well here it is! This film avoids all the traps of traditional biopics. Its tight timeline and electric performances distinguished it from similar stories that wind up feeling like nothing more than historical dramatization. I knew how this movie would end. I knew the basic story of the main character. And yet I hung on every moment. Kaluuya is that good and Stanfield is that good. More importantly the filmmakers are smart enough to figure out that this could be a story of betrayal advocacy loyalty and fear...something that transcended one persons story. What results is something both universal and uniquely relevant to the present day. This movie deserves whatever awards it wins.",8.0,727
ronakkotian, Kaluuya and Stanfield are striking in this unflinching film,After seeing The Trial of the Chicago 7 I read about the people involved and came across Fred Hamptons story which really fascinated me. I believe Judas and the Black Messiah did it justice.Judas and the Black Messiah follows Bill ONeal a man who becomes an FBI informant to gain inside information on the Deputy Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party Fred Hampton.After watching the first trailer I got goosebumps. Even after repeat viewings of the trailer I still got goosebumps. No trailer has made me feel like that before and so I was anticipating this film for a long time. This film was unflinching in its portrayal of its events and I loved every bit of it. It may be a disappointment to some as Fred Hampton isnt in the film as much as you would think but I thought showing this story through the perspective of ONeal was a great choice. Bill ONeal was an interesting person who did make choices that were questionable and I liked the conflict that built over time between his allegiance to the FBI and the Black Panther Party. Lakeith Stanfield gives one of his best performances here as ONeal. There are so many layers and nuances in his performance to give an idea of what his character is like. Despite knowing the story I was still stunned by some of the things ONeal does and somehow Stanfield still manages to make him somewhat sympathetic by the end.The main attraction here is Daniel Kaluuya who is mesmerising as Fred Hampton. He pulls off the accent brilliantly and adds so much charisma and power to the dialogue by Will Berson and Shaka King. A particular scene where hes speaking to a large group of people is made so powerful by the energy and confidence Kaluuya brings to each word that comes out of his mouth. I couldnt believe this was the same man from Get Out. This is the biggest chance for him to win a Best Supporting Actor award and I hope he does. Jesse Plemons is also amazing here. Im so happy his career is flourishing. Dominique Fishback is also fantastic and brings a level of emotion to the film.For a second feature this is really impressive from Shaka King. I see a great amount of confidence in his direction and writing and Im hoping to see more of him in the future. There are a couple of shootout scenes and its depiction of violence was hard-hitting and held a substantial amount of weight to it. The score is very unusual but at the same time I liked the way it was used in the film.All in all Judas and the Black Messiah is a powerful film. It brings to a light an important time in history and educates us on someone that wasnt that well known. With striking performances from Kaluuya and Stanfield this is a film that should be watched.,9.0,728
tylertoth-71980, Very informative,I had no idea any of this actually happened so its great that a film was made about this. This is a powerful film that I will recommend to anyone.,10.0,729
Kdosda_Hegen, Just an ordinary biographical political drama.,It is slow and just never gets engaging. The moral dilemma of Bill ONeal was too barebones and forced and Ive seen the crooked government portrayed in films way better and more interesting. Theres just nothing truly compelling in this film.,3.0,730
fdeveaux11, A poorly developed FBI-Informant relationship distracts from Fred Hampton's story,This film could have been much better. Instead of focusing on what made Fred Hampton such a powerful person - his politics his words his analysis - we are forced to sit through a bunch of cop-shoutouts and a fairly shallow version of an informant - FBI relationship story that weve seen done better in plenty of other movies.As for the character of Bill Oneil who unfortunately becomes the main character of the film we have no insight into his ideology or his motivations only that he wants money. The most interesting thing we learn about him is the real footage of the documentary that features at the end - which makes me wonder why Im not watching a documentary instead. Throughout the film theres nothing about him that makes it believable that hed be liked trusted and even integrated as an important person in the Panthers and as a close friend of Fred Hamptons.Overall pretty lame,5.0,731
devojonesy1977, MORE LAZY FILMMAKING.,"As an African American who have seen and read documentaries and biopics on Fred Hampton this movie I cannot recommend. Dont get me wrong after all Ive read and seen over the decades I STILL cant say that I know the full Fred Hampton story. But I know THIS film isnt anywhere NEAR a true depiction. This movie here is just trying to get some empathy awards during/before Oscar time based on race and the BLM movement. All that ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" really is is a slow emotional buildup to a black mans assassination. The SAD part is that this film could have easily been about ANY black man because it never once depicted the true Fred Hampton. The title "" Judas and the Black Messiah"" doesnt even focus on who Bill ONeal (Judas) was and what his motivations REALLY were. All we know from the ""filmmaker"" is that she views ONeal as a traitor. Why not tell us why? Because emotion kills logic so there doesnt have to be any truth OR logic right? If there are any people who are interested in more truth about Hampton or BBP? Try any and every documentary on the subject before you use this film as the truth.This movie is just more lazy filmmaking.",5.0,732
killerqueen-70395, Tiring,Two hours of my life and all I learned is that little has changed in 50 years at least for those on the extremes of society. Many in the black community have managed to move ahead but the spiritual grandkids and great-grandkids of the characters in this film spent last summer protesting and burning down cities. Perhaps the films value lies in the lesson that violence does not bring lasting change and that most Americans do not relate to either the Black Panthers or J. Edgar Hoover.

bheydam, Fantastic subject / Terrible movie,I wanted to LOVE this movie. The story of Fred Hampton like Huey Newton and the Black Panthers needs to be told. It is so relevant and important particularly the emphasis on socialism and the rainbow coalition. Could not be more timely.But the execution of this movie is awful. It is boring the character of Fred Hampton is poorly developed too much emphasis on the Judas character and worst of all the dialogue is very hard to understand. Seriously for all those people giving 10 stars please go back and watch Malcolm X. If this movie deserves 10 stars then Spike Lees movie deserves 10000 stars.Watch One Night In Miami instead - absolute masterpiece. I wish they had got King to direct this movie as well.,4.0,737
ratiocinator," ""Mumble, mumble."" What the hell are the actors saying?","I was thinking to myself ""Wow at last. A new movie that might actually be good."" Boy was I mistaken and disappointed. This is pure garbage. Whats the point in having actors read lines if barely a word they are saying can be understood?The actors are just mumbling away incoherently. Is there really any point in having dialogue in a script if hardly any of it can be understood? No there isnt. Why did Hollywood put this garbage out? They do check for this type of thing beforehand so its deliberate. Maybe they dont want us knowing what the actors said.Regardless this movie was only made because of the lunatic woke agenda and we all know it. If the woke Left hadnt cried ""racism"" so many times this would not have been made. Or would it? Maybe it would have but it would have been made by a better director - a competent director. And maybe it would have been made using actors that can read lines that can be understood by the audience.This garbage was nominated for an Oscar? Give me a break.

Rating such a stupid and time waste of a film so highly. The story is nothing we are not aware of so at least the execution should be good. But gosh is this the most boring film Ive watched! Wasted and spoiled my Sunday watching this horribly made film.This director should not make any note films. He doesnt know what he is doing. The ridiculous shoot out scenes were tedious to get through as was most of the film. The shoot out scenes reminded me of the painful to watch Bollywood gangster movies.

denise-99445, Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield Are Fantastic!,Huey P. Newton Bobby Seale Eldridge Cleaver are familiar names in Black Panther historical lore. Fred Hamptons story however is not well-known by the general public. This movie rights that travesty. The movie is simply fantastic well-acted produced and engrossing from the first frame. Daniel Kaluuya wears this role like a second skin. Whoever says a Brit cannot play an American revolutionary convincingly can go pound sand. LaKeith Stanfield plays Bill O Neal a Judas with such conviction it was difficult not to hate his character the entire movie. However he does manage to muster some sympathy as you see he begins to believe in the Black Panthers cause and is torn between the cause and his deception. Dominque Fishback does a nice job playing Hamptons love interest. Jesse Plemons as the crooked FBI agent was appropriately sleazy. Overall one of best movies so far this year.

PennyForMyThoughts, Powerful,"The direction of the film was tight and kept the narrative moving forward it never felt slow or forced.The acting was superb from top to bottom. Freds oratorical scene after being released from prison was some of the most powerful on screen rhetoric since Mel Gibsons ""freedom"" speech in Braveheart.The message of the film was extremely poignant in todays climate without feeling like it was over proselytizing. It was a historical dramatization nothing more and nothing less.The ending while it should have been predictable was nevertheless shocking and disturbing.Really well done overall a must watch in my opinion.",9.0,744
kaljic, An Outstanding Portrayal,Given the subject matter this movie is an unflinching unvarnished uncompromising look into the life and revolutionary thought of Fred Hampton.For those who are unfamiliar with Fred Hampton during the time of the Chicago 7 in the late Sixties Fred Hampton was the leader of the Black Panthers (not of course to be confused with the recent movie Black Panther) of Chicago. Long before the term was fashionable Hampton was able to forge what he called a rainbow coalition with other brown and white revolutionary groups which no doubt hastened his death. In December 1969 he was shot dead while he sleeping by members of the Chicago Police and FBI. There is no historical disagreement that J. Edgar Hoover personally directed the assassination of Fred Hampton. None of the participants were prosecuted nor even questioned following his assassination.The story is told through the eyes of the Judas the traitor in the organization Bill ONeil and his FBI handler. In life ONiel was Fred Hamptons closest associate so you can see how deep the FBI was able to penetrate the organization. While there are moments when the movie digresses into Hollywood hokum on the whole this movie is a sympathetic and accurate portrayal of the revolutionary thought of Fred Hampton. The focus of the film is Hamptons thoughts and dreams. By watching this film you will see the care with which that revolutionary thought was presented on the screen. It is both surprising and gratifying at the same time to see a major studio embark on this project and preserve Hamptons life memory and thoughts for a new generation.,10.0,745

severindringel, A well-told story about an important event,"The tragic story of former Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton has found a worthy recipient in director Shaka King. In his second feature film Shaka tells the story of the rise of the young Hampton in Chicago in the late 1960s. The latter is unaware that a member of his own ranks is cooperating with the FBI to put a stop to him and the party.Judas and the Black Messiah is marked by outstanding performances. Lakeith Stanfield acts as the ""Judas"" in the film i.e. traitor William ONeal who is infiltrated into the Black Panther group as a mole by FBI employee Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) after attempted car theft. The two share a very believable and atypical chemistry that almost makes you suspect a friendship of sorts. The real person behind William ONeal even said years later that he admired Mitchell. Stanfield is the real protagonist of the film. Large parts are taken up by Daniel Kaluuya as Fred Hampton the ""Black Messiah"" beloved by many but just as much opposed by many. Kaluuya is tailor-made for this role. He is electrifying powerful and does not hold back in illustrating his emotions. It is above all Kaluuyas eyes that say a great deal about his character and illustrate the determination Fred Hampton displayed to assert his values. Especially during speeches he lets it all out and combines all kinds of emotional states: suffering passion and anger towards the ""Pigs"" (racists). Dominique Fishback as Hamptons partner and mother-to-be Deborah takes up quite a bit of screen time and displays enormous poetry and passion in her few dialogues. She and Kaluuya also have terrific chemistry.Judas and the Black Messiah is ultimately just a semi-biopic about one of the most significant black freedom fighters in American history. The focus is on ONeals betrayal and Hamptons relentless fight against racism and for equality. Besides the superb acting performances the cinematography and Kings atmospheric direction stand out as major strengths. If the film can be criticised for anything it is that due to its lengthy structure it often fails to find a red thread and gets lost in arbitrary subplots a few times. These have relevance to the main plot but take up several minutes of the running time. Without Stanfields authentic acting his character would lack a lot of humanity because it is difficult to empathise with him despite him being the protagonist. The exact opposite is the case with Kaluuya who absolutely dominates and captivates the film. From start to finish he fills Hamptons big shoes brilliantly honouring a historical figure who unfortunately flies far too much under the radar. Judas and the Black Messiah is an excellently realised film and communicates important and educational incidents.",9.0,751

He is amazing in this role as a young leader of the party with rousing speeches and very convincing rhetoric. The film has a real Martin Scorsese vibe similar to films he did like The Departed. It has some great dialogue and incredible performances. I believe Kaluuya will win best supporting actor. The film is very slickly directed and I loved the score.

I wouldnt go into the specificities you should be the judge of what you see.Captivating acting from both of the lead actors Lakeith and Daniel has woven the film eloquently and the depth of the story will give a holistic history lesson.One of the best movie premised on black history till to this date. It deserves accolades popularity no matter how would you view the original story.,9.0,760
chriscarlisle25, POWERFUL! NEVER CLAPPED LOUDER!,I have not seen a movie in recent memory that evokes such a strong emotional reaction! All actors in this movie play their part superbly. Shouts out to the whole cast crew director and producers! This is an amazing piece of historical Cinema that does not pull any punches! It is not for the faint of heart and will definitely evoke strong emotions and anybody who is a human being so I would go into this with caution! **spoiler** it is quite sad that it took a 21 year old young man named Fred Hampton sacrificed his life in the quest for unity and equality and we are nowhere closer to that dream. All of our leaders we the people are either dead and gone or weak cowardly and afraid to make a move. The FBI and all of these government and federal/private organizations that do dirt are the problem. What they did to that young man and the whole Black Panther Party organization that was trying to better communities is absolutely horrible and they should not still be around! William ONeal died knowing that he made the biggest mistake one could ever make and that is betraying not only his people but a great young leader who could have potentially United the world all for a piece of change and to save his own ass from 5 years behind a prison cell. Was it worth it!? WHERE OH WHERE ARE OUR LEADERS! WHERE IS THE UNITY NOW!? WATCH THIS FILM! IM FEELING LIKE A REVOLUTIONARY! THIS FILM WILL KEEP THE SPARK LIT! 11/10 stars! Best film of 2021 thus far and one of the best of the early 21st century! PEACE! â˜®,10.0,761

view_and_review," I'm Biased, I Know","Watching ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" for me was more academic than entertainment. Some years ago I read the Jeffrey Haas book titled ""The Assassination of Fred Hampton"" so I was apprised of all the events surrounding Fred Hamptons death. More importantly I went through several stages of anger when reading the book which prepared me for the movie. So the question for me going in was: how will the movie measure up factually to the book I read?I say that the movie was brilliant. It was a fair and honest assessment of the Black Panther Party (BPP) especially at that time and it was a fair representation of Fred Hampton (played by Daniel Kaluuya). As far as the Judas in this saga William ONeal (LaKeith Stanfield) I knew very little about him and I didnt care to know much about him. I knew all I needed to know: he provided the floor plan of Freds home for Chicago P.D. to bust in and kill Fred in his sleep. Still ""Judas"" gives the audience a deeper look into the life of ONeal just before his involvement with the BPP up until the fateful day on December 4 1969. We get a picture of a confused man who while working for the FBI seems to want to help the BPP in its goals. But in all of his confusion he remains selfish in that self-preservation comes first for him.Fred Hampton on the other hand is the total opposite. Self-preservation and selfishness is not a part of his DNA. And what needs to be remembered is that Fred Hampton was only twenty-one when he was killed. He was a bright charismatic and sincere young man who accomplished much good and couldve accomplished so much more and I think ""Judas"" did a phenomenal job portraying that.Im biased I know. I have an affinity for Fred Hampton and the BPP though I wasnt alive during their reign so any positive portrayals Id probably like. Having said that I still look for accuracy and Ive read enough to be able to spot BS. Every movie is going to add dramatizations and an event here and there to increase the drama and I think thats acceptable so long as it doesnt significantly alter the facts. ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" toes the fact-line and also entertains.",9.0,764
nyxstrix, Just watch,Judas and the Black Messiah stands as a memorable powerful movie that leaves you wondering how Hampton might have evolved had he not been killed.

jesicadeste, Shock and outrage...,The best bit of the film is the part where modern mainstream America pretends that at some point between Fred Hamptons assassination and today the FBI just stopped doing evil things. Why is it the mainstream consensus is that secretive government agencies have only ever done evil things in the past no matter what point in time we happen to be in? In a few years there will be revelations about profoundly evil things that were done now by the CIA FBI and Pentagon. People will express shock and outrage and yet still believe on no basis whatsoever that those agencies have since stopped doing such evil things.

questl-18592, J and the BM,"Absolutely stellar performances in this film especially from Kaluuya and Stanfield. Honestly with the two of them I feel like were getting glimpses at the future acting stars in Hollywood because Ive yet to see either of them in something where theyre not delivering. Those two aside the rest of the cast here is solid as well with no real low notes to speak of. This is an acting film 100% driven by performances and yet that leads into the reason I dont love it as much as a lot of people seem to. These characters are all so fascinating and I feel like in an effort to capture the movement going on the film fails to live with these characters enough. When the credits rolled I felt unsatisfied with the amount of time spent with them and not in a ""Oh my god I could watch another three movies with these guys"" kind of way. So much is happening here that I never felt I got enough time to really focus on the journey some of these people are taking. Stanfield specifically feels like hes on a Donnie Brasco-esque journey of self discovery but rather than moving along in a natural steady pace it seems like his character jumps from stage to stage in his progression and I so wanted to see more of the turmoil and struggle he was going through.Thinking on that now I wonder if this wouldve been better off as a limited miniseries just because there is so much to cover and trying to push it all into one movie doesnt give enough time for all of it. Even a 5 hour long miniseries wouldve given enough time to really capture all the complexities the dilemmas facing these characters and I think wouldve been devastatingly powerful.As it stands Judas and the Black Messiah feels like a phenomenal display of acting talent but a bit of a misstep in terms of story and plotting and that latter hangup really prevents the strengths of this movie from being as powerful as I feel they could have been. I know Im in the minority here I know people are loving this movie and they absolutely should. Its solid and has an very prescient message. I just cant help but wonder about the greatness that could have been. Still recommend everyone watch this. Its worth it. I just didnt find myself swept up into the hype machine.",7.0,774

jadepietro, Looking for a Savior,IN BRIEF: An earnest but flawed exposÃ© with a star turn by Daniel Kaluuya as the Messiah.JIMS REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) It seems it is more than just documented facts that J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI illegally investigated any Black subversive protest groups during the 60s with the Black Panther Party as their No. 1 target. Recent films seem obsesses with that matter (One Night in Miami MLK/FBI The Trial of the Chicago Seven the soon-to-be -released The United States vs Billie Holiday). You can now add to the fold Shaka Kings searing indictment Judas and the Messiah.This bio-pic tells the true story of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) chairman of the BPP who is ultimately betrayed by an FBI informant William ONeal (Lakeith Stanfield). The film chronicles Mr. Hamptons life and death with a searing performance by Mr. Kaiuuya as the doomed crusader. There is no doubt that this performance will be recognized this award season. (More on that later.)We follow Mr. Hamptons journey from to skillful orator to full-blown leader his sweet relationship with Deborah (Dominique Fishback) and his so-called friendship with William. We also view Mr. ONeals involvement in petty crimes and criminal activities before he becomes the stoolie for FBI agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons under the behest of J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen with heavily applied make-up that borders on buffoonery).The script by Mr. King and Will Berson is a bit of a jumble and skims the surface before presenting its case. The movie allows a more liberal point of view from the filmmakers and crew in retrospect. The director/writer interweaves archival footage to his biographical tale most astutely and knows how to film his action scenes to full throttle effect. He does not shirk from showing the violence from both the police brutality and the Panthers own militant stance and pro-gun attitude. The director envisions his drama like an unfolding gangster saga with fluid camerawork and stylish flourishes although his decision to use an annoying atonal music score just add more injury to ones eardrums. All in all the film still resonates with its factual baseline and superb acting in general. One cannot discount the redacted facts and the shady cover-up that are now part of historical record.This is an honest but empathetic view of the Black struggle which shows the desperate violent lengths the Black Panthers would go for their cult-like cause which almost seems to justify Hoovers insistence about this groups dangerous origins and his underhanded tactics in taking this group out. But the portrayal of the FBI and their fearful leader is strictly one-dimensional. The Feds are predictable cardboard bad guys that become absurd caricatures rather than real figures. That seriously hinders the films impact.The film loses much of its momentum whenever Freds story is pushed aside in favor of showcasing scenes of ONeals issues and the FBI arch villainy. The reliable Mr. Pleson is fine as the cold and calculating FBI agent but Mr. Sheen is miscast as Hoover. Granted the waxy make-up doesnt help his performance. It only makes him look like a supporting cast member of The Sopranos than J. Edgar. The screenplay would have been wiser to eliminate the physicality of this well known figure entirely.In accurately conveying the 60s era of racial unrest the main Judas role is underdeveloped. Mr. Stanfield is very good as William and the actor tries to fill in the gaps to this solitary loser but as written ONeal is more a series of nervous tics and fearful glances than a real person who one cares about.What the film does best is honoring its Black Messiah and his Lady Madonna storyline. As previously stated Mr. Kaluuya is sensational. His role has more depth and emotional nuance. Mr. Hamptons revolutionary speech after his arrest is totally mesmerizing in its delivery. But it is the films quieter scenes with Mr. Kaluuya and the captivating Ms. Fishburne that provide the gravitas needed. They are the emotional core. Their final scene is a heartbreaker and staged so powerfully in its straightforward use of graphic violence and human cruelty.Well crafted and skillfully performed Judas and the Messiah has many strong moments scattered between some scenes of loose and meandering storytelling. It takes a while to build its narrative but it does so by its tragic end. (GRADE: B-)NOTE: The R&B song during the closing credits Fight for You is a real winner. Take a listen.,7.0,779

beeryusa, What's with all the anachronistic berets?,Im seeing a lot of black berets in this movie. The problem is theyre not accurate. Clearly the makers of this movie purchased a lot of modern military berets for the film. Unfortunately these berets are nothing like the berets the black Panthers wore back in the day. Todays military berets have a smaller crown and theyre much stiffer so they need a lot of work to get them to sit right on a persons head. The berets the Black Panthers wore were bigger softer and with a bigger crown.Also Fred Hampton wore hats but Ive never seen any photo of him wearing a black beret. He may have worn one on occasion but it was clearly not a hat he liked to wear.If the movie makers cant get details like this right I worry that theyll get other details wrong too. At some point I hope Fred Hampton gets the movie bio he deserves but I have doubts that this is it.,5.0,781

mrlami, This movie is definitely going on the re-watch list,"This movie is definitely going on the re-watch listThe title accurately describes the relationship between ""William ONeal"" and ""Fred Hampton"" for a brief period in the 60s before ONeal assisted the FBI in killing Hampton.It begs the question ""does the time/moment make the man or is it vice versa""? The probability at the time based on the events happening in the United States with race relations and Edgard Hover (then FBI director) doing everything in his power to orchestrate the deaths of black activist naturally gave rise to a Messiah ""Hampton"" and a Judas ""ONeal"" who would betray him.Both Daniel Kaluuya (playing Hampton) and Lakeith Stanfield (playing ONeal) do a fantastic work embodying their characters and re-enacting them to life. Very much like the carpenter from 2000 years ago 1/3 the world still worships Fred Hampton was indeed a Messiah that pointed out the hypocrisy in the American system and preached sermons that empowered and brought unlikely factions of people together. He frequently said ""power anywhere theres people"" a wise timeless insight.",9.0,784

tayloroverstreeta, So Memorable it Felt like I Was There,"This was one of the most moving and well put-together films Ive seen. Every moment was expertly paced Daniel Kaluuyah was absolutely tantalizing and the score was a perfect mix of fresh and old sounds of blues and jazz- new and old. The wardrobes are immaculate and the color schemes stay in brand in their entirety. At this point Jesse Plemons has played every reproachable human being beyond salvation and his performance here is no difference. His performance is profoundly disturbing.The dialogue is endlessly quotable but what it does as a whole is take the viewer with the Black Panthers into their mission and introduces them to the brotherhood and the community that surrounds the revolution. Many scenes make it easy to humanize and love the Messiah showing Fred in his everyday life steadfast and incorruptible. The love and spirit extending through the Panthers makes it even more reprehensible that someone like Bill (Lakeith Stanfield acting his face off) could remain a rat for so long. Themes touch upon racism systematic oppression and the duality of individual survival versus community good.This is by far one of the best movies Ive ever seen. The acting was amazing from all angles and there was not a single moment that felt lacking in suspense or sentiment. I left feeling sad and angry at Americas recent and shameful history but also inspired to learn more about the history of the Black Panthers and the immense sacrifices they made as a group and as individuals.An example of the comedic timing punctuating the film: during opening minutes""WHO IS THIS?""Crowd: ""HUEY P.

TaylorYee94, Watch this one with 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' if you want active viewing.,Both are based on the true story which happened in Chicago in 1968 and 1969 so two movies give the whole picture of what it was like in Chicago in late 60s. Social oppression protest in reaction polices excessive force of use discrimination against the weaker are the words to describe atmosphere around that time. Its interesting to compare and contrast how Fred Hampton is realized in two movies. Other than that there are many things to compare and contrast both contents and the forms.Judas and the Black Messiah is disappointing that the director could have done so much more with such an important historical figure (similar with The Trial of the Chicago 7). The screenwriting is stretched and elongated. The momentum and the tension have to be built up for December 4th Monroe Massacre where all the powerful emotions burst. However the director fails not only to build up but also to have a great ending.P.S. History speaks that William ONeal is still a weak coward then and now.,7.0,790

lee_eisenberg, the revolution will stand,"For years I had heard about Fred Hampton. As a community organizer in 1960s Chicago he was influential in uniting various groups in an armed struggle. Not surprisingly this made him a prime target of the police.Shaka Kings ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" focuses both on Hampton and on William ONeal a car thief hired by the FBI to infiltrate the Black Panthers. What the movie really introduced me to was the passion with which Hampton gave his speeches in calling for revolution as well as how the FBI manipulated ONeal into betraying Hampton.Daniel Kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as Hampton. His fiery orations make you feel as if youre present in his audience. The rest of the cast is mainly there to support him namely LaKeith Stanfield as ONeal. Nonetheless its an excellent movie showing the power of one the USs most important political movements and the governments aim of crushing it (make no mistake: J. Edgar Hoover - played by Martin Sheen in the movie - was a truly evil person). As Hampton said you can kill a revolutionary but you cant kill the revolution.",10.0,795
hunter-friesen," ""Judas"" invigorates Fred Hampton's legacy","Fred Hampton was only 21-years-old when he was murdered by Cook County police in an illegal home raid in 1969. He was drugged with a sedative to prevent him from fighting back and shot twice in the head while sleeping in front of his nine-month pregnant partner Deborah Johnson.Even though he died young Hampton had already accomplished more than many of us could ever dream. As chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party Hampton founded the multicultural organization the Rainbow Coalition and allied his party with other Chicago groups in an effort to end street violence and instigate social change. He was a born leader and speaker moving hundreds with his words at the protests and educational courses he led.Now after fifty years since his untimely death Hampton is getting the biopic treatment in ""Judas and the Black Messiah"".The British-born Daniel Kaluuya portrays Hampton in a performance that can only be described as electrifying. Kaluuya has already made himself known with his lead performance in Jordan Peeles ""Get Out"" and a supporting turn as a sadistic hitman in Steve McQueens ""Widows"". Here Kaluuya elevates his game even further as he channels both the powerfulness Hampton carried in public and the tenderness he had in private. There isnt one second youre not glued to him while hes on screen. An Oscar nomination is bound to happen and a win would be deserved.Playing Judas to Hamptons Black Messiah is LaKeith Stanfield (also in ""Get Out"" as the brainwashed Andre King). Stanfield plays William ONeal who was a petty Chicago criminal who became an informant for the FBI as he rose the ranks within the Black Panthers. ONeal was the one that sedated Hampton in exchange for $200000 an act he never considered a betrayal. Stanfield rises close to the level of Kaluuya as he gives a twitchy and layered performance that is nothing short of a career-best.Directed and co-written by Shaka King ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" meets both criteria of a biopic which is to be both entertaining and informative beyond the top-layer Wikipedia facts. We learn about Hampton through ONeal as we watch him ascend from the bottom to the top within the party interacting with Hampton at various points in history.King doesnt commit the sin of falling head over heels with his subject. Like the Messiah in the holy book Hampton had his demons that he had to constantly wrestle with. King takes a similar approach that Steven Spielberg took with ""Lincoln"" where we get a compelling real-life hero and learn about what they had to overcome both externally and internally. This treatment also extends to ONeal whom King doesnt wholly vilify or pardon. Were shown the path ONeal initially led himself down and how he saw an opportunity to work for the FBI. While its an easy decision to make King lets the audience decide how to perceive ONeals actions.With Steve McQueens go-to cinematographer Sean Bobbitt in his crew King makes this one of the most surprisingly gorgeous movies of the year. Incorporating a mixture of long takes and over-saturation King and Bobbitt perfectly illustrate the vibrant urban setting. And the jazz-infused score carries the sharp tension with its low trombones.At just over two hours long King carries his film with great energy from beginning to end. Expertly filmed action is interspersed throughout as well as sharply edited speeches that contain more action than the actual shootouts. Even when King falters for a few brief moments at the beginning of the third act he picks himself back up and delivers an utterly spine-chilling and infuriating ending that properly uses the clichÃ©d element of postscript.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is an all-powerful work from director Shaka King and the two leads of Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield. Both timely and historical this biopic will surely land near the top of my best-of-year list and is not one to miss.",8.0,796

blott2319-1," 2 movies in 1, should have just been 1","Theres definitely a bunch of interesting stories to tell about the Black Panthers and their battle for civil rights but while its hard to put my finger on the exact reason why I felt that Judas and the Black Messiah wasnt quite as good at telling its story as I was hoping it might be. I think one of the biggest problems I had with this script is the fact that it is bisected down the middle and doesnt stick with a singular narrative. On the one hand it is about Fred Hampton and his rise to leadership in the Black Panther party. This is a powerful story and one that I think could keep an audience riveted for the full run-time of a film. I thought Daniel Kaluuya did a superb job of portraying this man who could appear larger than life while still keeping him grounded so we could relate to him. I found some of the intimate moments he has in the film to be the most compelling aspect of the entire plot because it contrasted nicely with his big personality when in front of a crowd. Fred Hamptons story is what worked best for me and I would have enjoyed exploring his journey the entire time along with the general rise and fall of the Black Panthers movement.Yet there is another story being told here and it wouldnt be hard to argue that this is intended to be the main plot of the entire film. This is where we learn about Bill ONeal and how he rose up the ladder of the Black Panthers while still being an informant for the FBI. I know that it can be interesting to take a look at this journey but it didnt connect with me as deeply. For starters drawing the analogy to ""Judas"" feels flawed because this was not a man who belonged to the Black Panther party before being recruited by the FBI. Hes basically an undercover agent and that makes it hard to feel tension or stress for him the entire time. The movie makes it crystal clear that he is in the wrong for what he is doing so why should I care if he is unmasked. LaKeith Stanfield even plays him a bit weaselly and conniving which just makes him even less likable. I will say that I appreciated the way this film utilized Jesse Plemons character because it is rare for a movie like this to show a white person with some conflicted feelings (typically they are all shown as pure evil and 100% racist.) There is a decent movie in Judas and the Black Messiah I just wish there wasnt also a lackluster movie in there.",6.0,798

Expertly crafted with a booming soundtrack precise and meaningful cinematography and outstanding compelling performances from Daniel Kaluuya LaKeith Stanfield Jesse Plemons and Dominique Fishback.After the previous year of not seeing (m)any new movies its easy to feel like nothing is on the horizon besides superheroes director/producer/co-writer Shaka King slaps us in the mouth with a new film that is reinvigorating and bold.Movies like this remind me why I love movies so much. Why I need movies and why stories like this are incredibly important on many different levels. And why its important to see new films from young filmmakers.See it anyway you possibly can right now. My local arthouse theater in Portland invited me to a virtual screening I believe its also coming to HBO MaxSupport art.Support film.Support black art.Support black film.,10.0,800
alistairpmcduffie47, Daniel Kaluuya's 1st Oscar win coming up!,Ive been waiting for this film for a while and man I have to say I was not disappointed at all. The performances are phenomenal especially from Daniel Kaluuya. I challenge you to look up a clip of Fred Hampton watch the film and then spot out a moment where Kaluuyas demeanor mannerisms and voice werent akin to Hamptons. Lakeith Stanfield is also really great. While I understand Daniel Kaluuyas Fred Hampton is the central character of the film Stansfields performance and character William ONeal helps drive the movie. He convincingly plays a man whos drowned in the cynicism of being black during the 1960s. In addition to the performances the entire film is crafted extremely well from the costume design and music to the cinematography. Especially as the film concludes there are scenes directed and shot so well they will stick with viewers long after watching.I really had to force myself to think of something negative here. One thing I wish however is that certain female characters were written with a little more depth. For example Dominique Fishback is stellar as Hamptons significant other but I feel like she could have been utilized a bit more. Some may also have a problem with the story focusing on ONeal just as much as Hampton. I also felt some of the prosthetics particularly in the case of J Edgar Hoover were a little distracting as well.Overall its rare in which almost every aspect of a film is remarkable and this is exactly that. I see many Oscar nominations in its future with Stanfield getting a best supporting actor nod. As for Kaluuya there is no doubt in my mind he will win Best Actor. Aside from what the film achieves technically it offers an inside look into one of the most misconstrued political movements of our time. Its as informative as it is emotional. Regardless how hard aspects of it may be to watch I encourage you to do so.,9.0,801

lacatusalexandru, One of the most powerfull films.,Judas and the Black Messiah isin my opinionThe Best Film of The Year.Shaka Kings movie has achieved every task in order to become an Academy Award FilmKing talks in Judas and the Black Messiah about:racismthe human naturethe human rights as well as showing us that being diferentin Americais a crime.I have to say that the cast is beyond amazingespecially the duo between Daniel Kaluuya(Fred Hampton/The Black Messiah) and Keith Stanfield(Wiliam ONeal/Judas).By the waythe soundtrack is something that Id never heard in a long time.Every sound/song is electrifying and great.As for the plot/story arc of the filmthe 1st and the last act are beautiful but the 2nd act is a bit confusing but nonetheless is still great.Watching Judas and The Black Messiahfor a secondit made me feel like I was watching either a Spike Lee film or a Martin Scorsese movie.Thats how great Shaka Kings motion picture iseven better than some of the films produced by Lee or Scorsese.I just hope that either Kaluuya or Stanfieldif not bothwill win an Academy Award for their magnificient performances.OverallJudas and The Black Messiah is definitely the best film of the year and try and see it as soon as you can because you wont know what you miss.,10.0,807
lkgleeson, Judas and the Black Messiah,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a richly told story of the leadership revolutionary activism and eventual assassination of Black Panther Fred Hampton and powerful addition to the social revolution films of the 1960s and early 1970s.Seeing history brought to life in a viscerally real and emphatic manner made the work very compelling to me.Fred Hampton was killed at the age of 21 on December 4th 1969. The aggrieved parties would wait well over a decade for justice with a civil suit settlement of $1.85 million in 1982 after an initial coroners jury inquest in January of 1970 found Fred Hamptons death justifiable homicide.The writing pulls heavily from historical texts with Black Panther phrases such as ""War is politics with blood. Politics is war without blood."" King also manages to pose questions about how to make progress as his characters address the concepts of reform and revolution. While the film is set in 1968-69 these issues are still prevalent today. On HBO Max. Do yourself a favor and check it out. Youll be glad you did.",10.0,808

cornerofspace, Eye-opening.,As someone who did not know the real events or people this movie was based on it was an eye-opening experience into what life was like back then. The camera work is rock solid with genuine tense moments and powerful performances from the main characters.Watching the events unfold back then brings an interesting juxtaposition to recent events in America. Police brutality rooted in racism is still a reality. People in power with discriminatory beliefs still exists. It made me think about several realities that are still going on today. It made me think about how people in power can easily abuse their position. We like to think regulation is important to keep these people in check but whos regulating the regulators? People in power can easily hire regulators to maintain the status quo.And what about crime rates? It disproportionately involves people of color because of centuries of racism that become rooted in the very culture of children born in lower socioeconomic groups. Violence begets violence and crime begets more crime. Were definitely living in a better time now than what it was like 50 years ago. But we can do better. And nothing is more powerful than educating the next generation about the truth about critical thinking and about actively doing what they believe is right.I have barely talked about this film but I appreciate that a film like this exists. It allows the viewer into a glimpse of the past informing the audience about an issue that perhaps they may not understand. It puts us directly into the shoes of a group of people doing what they think is right for their future generation. It is creative works like these that may challenge your world view and it may help you understand about the struggles and plight of people that are different than you. To that I applaud the film.For those who have no idea about the real events like I was this is a great film to increase your awareness on a subject you might not know much about.,8.0,810
nouyrigatantoine," a masterpiece biopic, unfortunately still relevant today.",An excellent film brilliantly interpreted and directed by Shaka King telling the true story of a young leader of the black panthers murdered by the FBI. The film is told from the perspective of an FBI infiltrator within the movement.This true story is a violent slap in the face as things have not changed since then and reminds us of the extent to which injustice political bashings and an oppressive police force are still on the rise. Numerous archive images slipped throughout the film illustrate this drama and its issues which unfortunately have not aged 50 years. Any attempt to emancipate the people from the system is systematically drowned out by a minority of powerful wishing to preserve their way of life by using endless methods of division stigmatization and mounted blows including assassinations. A great biopic.,9.0,811

fciocca," A powerful performance by Daniel Kaluuya, such an intense and amazing biopic about Fred Hampton","This movie can be complementary to ""The Trial of the Chicago Seven"" and it deepen the story of the Black Panthers party and how were subject to injustices by the FBI and the Police Department in an historical time where racism was extremely bad and costed a lot of innocent lives. Such a tragedy that here is portrayed in a realistic and bloody way. Definitely not an easy watch.Daniel Kaluuyas performance was simply amazing he has such an intense energy during stage scenes and he simply nailed Freddy Hampton characterization. For sure one of the best portrayal of the first part of 2021 he completely captured me. Also LaKeith Stanfield did a good job. Bill ONeill a man that in order to run away from crime charges was infiltrated by the FBI into the Black Panthers headquarters in order to provide information to authorities and avoid prison. However he will pay a really high toll and the real guy not able to handle anymore this weight decided to end his own life. He was really on a though spot but the FBI definitely used him to do the dirty job. Unfair agency strategies are very often reported in the film and even if these are well known facts it is still disgusting what the USA were able to do in order to meet their own agenda.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is very balanced it never tried to paint Hampton as a hero director managed to be impartial by highlighting both negative and positive aspect of the movement: the main objective was definitely noble but means used were not always orthodox. No politically correctness involved here and I am happy that WB just let the director tell the story in his own way by presenting real facts. I am extremely satisfied with this movie and I highly suggest to watch it together with the Netflix original mentioned at the beginning.",7.0,813

Anurag-Shetty, Flawless biopic.,Judas and the Black Messiah is the true story of Bill ONeal(LaKeith Stanfield). Bill is an FBI informant who is instructed to spy on the Black Panther Party and its chairman Fred Hampton(Daniel Kaluuya). As he gets closer to the party and Fred Bill is lost and doesnt know what to do.Judas and the Black Messiah is a mind-blowing film. Director Shaka King has given us a biopic that pays tribute to all the unsung heroes of the Black Panther Party. The performances are the highlight of the film. LaKeith Stanfield is spectacular as Bill ONeal. Stanfield portrays his characters emotional turmoil with ease & aplomb. Daniel Kaluuya is outstanding as Fred Hampton. Kaluuya nails his portrayal of the inspirational leader. Jesse Plemons is unforgettable as Roy Mitchell. Dominique Fishback is phenomenal as Deborah Johnson. The supporting cast is superb. Judas and the Black Messiah deserves all the awards nominations and the accolades it has already received. A must watch.,10.0,815

Thanos_Alfie, Black Panther...,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch a man who is an informant of the FBI infiltrating the Black Panther Party. He has to gain their trust and give the information he has to the FBI. His work is very difficult and many times is on the ledge.I liked this movie very much because it was very interesting full of suspense and it contained many great scenes. Regarding the direction which was made by Shaka King it was very good and he created a great mysterious atmosphere that was kept through the whole duration of the movie. The interpretations of both Daniel Kaluuya who played as Fred Hampton and LaKeith Stanfield who played as Bill ONeal were simply amazing and I believe they elevated the movie. Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was Jesse Plemons who played as Roy Mitchell. To sum up I have to say that ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is a great biography movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",8.0,822
creator301, Solid film.,Big movie attitude telling a story that wants to be heard. Not enough focus on character development leaves you wanting but the story itself is interesting enough to carry you til the end.

His friend William is a dirty rat who turns on him. J. Edgar Hoover is the worst scum as well. You definitely love to hate them.

cruise01, Intriguing and strong drama with great performances.,4 out of 5 stars.Judas and the Black Messiah is a good biographical drama film about BIll (Lakeith Stanfield) impersonating as an FBI towards other african americans to steal there cars. When he is captured by Roy (Jesse Plemons) and becomes an informant to infiltrate the black panther party that is run by Fred (Daniel Kaluuya).Good plot. Strong drama. The film does play very similar to The Departed film with Lakeith Stanfield going undercover with Black panther party. While they believe there is a rat in there organization which Bill is trying to stay hidden away. While the police law enforcement are continuously taunting and discriminating them.Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya delivers powerful performances. The film does have some intense and thrillinf direction. With a moving script about people being discriminated for there race.The film does lose its momentum by the time it reaches its third act. Otherwise it is a good film.,8.0,825

elicopperman, Necessary Look into the Black Panther Movement,In a day and age where acknowledgement of marginalized American citizens has become more prevalent than ever films like Judas and the Black Messiah feel like necessary additions to the struggles of the black panther movement in the late 60s and early 70s. With beloved actors Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield and a healthy distribution from HBO Max backing the project up this film is surely to be a contender for the eventual 2021 oscars. So what makes this film worthy of not only critical appraisal but also Kaluuyas Screen Actor Guild award?As the film depicts the rise and fall of revolutionary activist Fred Hampton (Kaluuya) what makes the film striking is how it presents all these details in a powerfully bold manner. Not unlike the movements from Malcolm X or Bobby Seale the way Hampton struck fear and determination through his brash speeches allowed the movements for racial justice to grow bigger and bigger over the years. Considering just how many enemies Hampton had on his shoulders as much as allies it made the movement he helped lead that much more of a target to the racist FBI. And yet this movie itself is just as focused on FBI informant William ONeal (Stanfield) coaxing with Hampton in an attempt to reimburse his status to lead in on the movement even if it does cost him the solid relationship he builds with Hampton. While one could argue ONeals special agent handler Roy Mitchell doesnt quite have the same developed amount of substantive screen time as he could have to make ONeals time with him memorable at the end of the day the relationship between ONeal and Hampton wins by default in terms of plot points.One could even argue the movie is at its peak in sequences rather than the whole. While the scenes of Hamptons partner Deborah Johnson are gorgeously romantic and all the more heartbreaking as the film goes on the scenes with Martin Sheen portraying J. Edgar Hoover are so hamfistedly jingoistic that it comes off more as a parody than a serious stake. Fortunately Sean Bobbitts phenomenal cinematography and Kristan Spragues tight editing allows the pacing of these scenes to smooth well enough even if some are written and performed better than others. Also director Shaka King does not hold back on displaying just how violent this film can get in depicting what the panthers and FBI get themselves into as it allows more of a gut punch to the viewers than first expected. It seems that today the views people have towards the federal police have grown steadily worse overtime especially from the views of African Americans. So with films like this showcasing the paranoid induced violence sticks out like a necessary evil that should not be forgotten anytime again.If you own HBO Max and youre in the mood for a solid biopic on racial injustice and ambivalence being its own downfall Judas and the Black Messiah is a healthy contender. Its debatable if the movie will stand the test of time as one of the great biopics on black historical events but nevertheless it will hopefully make a cultural impact in this still ongoing pandemic. With many audiences desperately in need of being reeducated on black history this film will mark a triumphant return to the months prevalence in reminding us why we shouldnt take these objective tales for granted.,7.0,827

arabnikita, Lives up to its Biblical Title,Judas and The Black Messiah (2021)Two things that come to mind when hearing the name Judas: Jesus Christ and betrayal. Judas loved Jesus he believed in his ideas he was his close friend and yet he betrayed him for 30 silver coins. After being arrested by the FBI Bill ONeal finds himself joining the Black Panthers as a spy. Initially he doesnt care about their struggle as he is in it purely to avoid incarceration. However once Fred Hamptons revolutionary ideas manage to crawl into his mind Bill finds himself at a moral crossroad.On one side he likes staying out of jail while getting paid by the FBI; on the other he feels the rebellious spirit coursing through his veins as he gets closer and closer to The Black Messiah and LaKeith plays that part to perfection. Daniel Kaluuya gives a volcanic performance as Fred Hampton and yet it felt like a miscasting despite his tremendous energy. The real 21 year old Fred looked like a man of knowledge with wisdom beaming out of his eyes; the same couldnt be felt about Daniel who is also 10 years older. Furthermore instead of delving deeper into Freds life the movie limits his time while choosing to focus on shootouts.What is important in any revolutionary film specially if it aims to be realistic is to portray both sides of the coin and I think this movie doesnt achieve that objective. Instead of focusing on counter politics Bills motivations or Freds backstory the film runs all over the place as events and characters are introduced without any development simply for the sake of adding layers and creating noise.Despite losing its focus the movie successfully establishes a core idea which will hopefully inspire peole to read about these events. Aesthetically the film felt immersive as the revolutionary spirit was flowing through the screen; Kendrick Lamars Hiii Power would have fit nicely here. Giving credit where credit is due the movoe stayed true to the title by managing to make it all about Judas and his weakness. On the day when he was tasked with the ultimate betrayal Bill burst into tears just as Judas cried when he had to betray Jesus and in a way that felt poetic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movies and Tv shows,7.0,829
MOscarbradley, A shocking slice of recent American history.,"A knowledge of American history over the last fifty years and in particular a knowledge of what went down in the Black Panther Movement would help but is far from essential in getting a great deal out of Shaka Kings superb new film ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" which tells the story of how Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was betrayed by F.B.I. informant Bill ONeal leading to his assassination by J. Edgar Hoovers thugs supposedly acting in the name of the law. Its a shocking story and since I wasnt aware of these events before I suppose I approached the film like a piece of good fiction (its certainly not trying to be a documentary) and it grips like any really good thriller should.A terrific Daniel Kaluuya (in Oscar-worthy form) is Hampton and the consistently brilliant LaKeith Stanfield is just as good as his Judas while Jessie Plemons has his best big-screen role to date as the F.B.I. agent who recruits ONeal. Dominque Fishback is also very good as the activist who falls for Hampton and has his son. This is an actors piece in the best sense of the term and its beautifully shot by Sean Bobbitt. Of course its also a deeply political film and the audience for political films is limited and without that prior knowledge I spoke of you might find some of it confusing but as a thriller about betrayal and as an expose of how ruthless governments can be (nothing new there of course) it works superbly and ultimately thats all that matters. How much of it actually happened in the way King tells it I have no idea but it certainly feels right and it deserves to be widely seen.",8.0,830

magsmovies, Too pretentious to be genuine,Nobody talks like this in the middle of a heated argument especially with alcohol involved. The passion was there in the physical acting but the verbose lines felt entirely too premeditated and rehearsed to be delivered organically as they would be in a spontaneous lovers spat. They just take turns spouting off eloquently composed diatribe. Cinematography is the one redeeming quality. Beyond that I couldnt get past the toxicity of their psychological jabs to find the takeaway of this abusive character study with no resolution. In summation: TLDR; Relationships are messy and Sam Levinsons grudge for Katie Walsh runs deep.,5.0,833
Kikijeanne, Stage...ish.,The way its written and performed is done more in the style of a stage production not the normal naturalism youd expect on screen. Can makes it seem overacted. I dont know its a stylistic choice... I just dont know if its a choice the director intended to make. Someone here said its like a collection of acting exercises which is pretty accurate.Didnt finish. Some might like it some might not. Could feel the presence of some over-directing in it.

salmamahfouz, Fake deepness,I really dont know..!I felt the whole movies was forced to be artistic but it is not. I felt that the dialogue was so unauthentic i dont believe this would be a real fight.. one talks and the other listens then reply back.. this doesnt happen. They used big words that no one ever use in a fight. There whole part about the filmmaker complaining from the critics is so forced.. i felt it was so irrelevant to the whole story.The whole of black and white is kind of forced so people would feel that it is a deep artistic movie while in fact i felt it was so shallow.For example marriage story was a movie about couples arguing and was so authentic than this one we would be lessening marriage story if we compare it to this one.Zendayas acting was disturbing.. i felt she was also forcing the drama and forcing the reactions there was something so weird about the way she talks and reacts.At the end i guess that if this movie is divided into separate stories in a separate short film it would be much better.,4.0,835
dashtag1234, Should Have Been A Short Film,This movie starts out really solid the first 20 minutes feel like a really good short film. The movie shouldve just ended there. Basically after that the conversation and conflict between characters just go in circles for another hour and a half. Its basically pointless. Movie is also very pretentious with this black-and-white filter making it look all artsy but its really just trying to act cool. The acting is pretty good but nothing can save this movie from its terrible pacing. It is very dull and feels like we are hearing words directly out of the directors mouth.

Jeremy_Urquhart," Has its moments for sure, but can't quite sustain itself through all 106 minutes",Probably would have been better as a short film because it really started to drag and feel a little repetitive in the second half.Its a decent effort to do one of those one-location limited cast kind of movies but it is let down in the writing with some dialogue that feels very overwritten at points and a lot of scenes that feel like they hammer home the same point again and again. You could argue its intentional but Im sure there would be ways to have that repetition as a theme without making the film feel like a bit of a chore to sit through after about the 50-minute mark.That being said: even though the black and white cinematography doesnt seem to serve a concrete purpose it does look fairly nice. And the film is saved by its two performances who do surprisingly good work with a screenplay packed with lines (and whole scenes) that would be difficult to act convincingly.Overall its far from terrible and I did get a fair bit of enjoyment out of the first half and small parts here and there in the second but it doesnt quite sustain itself well enough to justify the feature-length runtime in my opinion.,5.0,837

""its pretentious"" ""not engaging"" ""its just about a couple fighting"". You dont have to like the film but at the very least be original in your criticism.Its clear to me people are losing their sense of realism with being glued to the enormous trend of superhero sci-fi films and unnecessary sequels. Cinema is also about intriguing dialogue with realistic earthly circumstances. Sometimes you need to appreciate a more realistic emotional story.This film is simple yet at the same time complex as what most relationships are. Human emotion and romance isnt sappy or cheesy one liners you see in sitcoms. Its deep its raw its cruel and it crosses boundaries.I give it a 7/10 overall its a good film with excellent acting however the only critique I have with the film is that it remains the same with no unexpected twists or turns revealed.",7.0,839

The shifting balance between the two characters keeps us on edge the entire time and were never quite sure where its taking us next. Its definitely a daring film to make and Im sure it will split audiences by a large margin. Its not very easy to digest and I believe it would be better suited for the stage than the screen.

chrispedley-34371, Dull!,Dull if you want to watch a couple argue for an hour and half come round to mine after I roll home worse for wear after an afternoon out with the lads. Its probably more fun than this pseudo intellectual tripe.,1.0,847
Samuel-18, Waste of time,Great acting but horrible characters and script. Tough movie to get through with such unlikeable characters to watch for 100 mins literally arguing about useless crap. And the way Malcolm eats mac and cheese was one the most annoying things ive ever had to watch lol. Dont waste your time.,3.0,848
amber_edgar, literally just one long argument,... I was so ready to love this movie... But its literally just one long fight?? Neither character is likable theyre both just yelling at each other from the start to the finish. With the cinematography and the actors... I feel like it could have been really good. But theres nothing appealing about just watching a 100 minute long argument.,2.0,849
robynjanecahill, unjustified,Ive to say i agree with other reviewers stances that once youve seen the first 30 minutes youve seen it all. it was exhausting to watch an hour and 40 minute long argument especially one that went around in circles and repeated itself several times. a contributing factor to this is the characters who despite being played by good likeable actors are both completely insufferable. zendaya gives a pretty good performance but i cant say the same about jdw. he wasnt awful but it almost felt like he was acting for stage instead of screen. and the mac and cheese scene??? terrible. although i think the director is more to blame for that one speaking of whom... i have to say i think on the part of levinson this film is incredibly self indulgent. you can tell he thought he was making an insightful and emotional drama but as i wrote before there is nothing new to be found in this film after the first half hour. unless you love watching people argue for way longer than you need to you can skip this one.,4.0,850

Alexander_Blanchett, A Thin Line between Love and Hate,"They fight - they try to have sex - they fight - they try to have sex - they fight - they try to have sex. Thats the whole movie in a nutshell. And you as the audience wonder if they end up having sex or not. Thats the plot.Ok that was really a very shallow view on this film as there is indeed more it tells but its nothing really new. We had that intimate look at a couples relationship a lot of times before and there is not much to add. Sometimes the film feels like an extended version of the fight scene between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". We learn a lot about the two characters lives their past and they emotions. There are a few heartbreaking moments that really make it worthwhile. The acting is great too which is the biggest bonus the film has. Without John David Washington and Zendaya there wouldnt be much left except for an excellent cinematography. But the screenplay is not really that thrilling. It just plays around with various topics of fights a couple that questions their relationship their motives. And all of that. Again had that a dozens time before. The acting and style is what makes it special. The direction by Sam Levinson is also not too shabby. John David Washington is great and shows another range of his immense talent. This is also the film that hopefully gives Zendaya the respect as an actress she deserves. Both are fantastic both have showed scenes. Both play off each other its hard to say who is better but in the essence we see a great showcase of two actors who will have a long and exciting career in Hollywood who are about to become the leading actors of a new generation.All in all not a bad film but nothing too thought provoking.",7.0,856
kapanennpate, They fight is what makes is so beautiful,I know that people will say that it is just fighting for whole movie and I say to them yes and that makes it so beautiful.It feels real you can feel it. You can feel the love between them you can feel all.The shots are beautiful and the way that they have used music. All of the shots tell something to you. Is someone scared or angry etc...I truly think that if you dont like this movie you should just watch Superhero movies. This is a masterpiece,10.0,857
trinaboice, Brilliant piece of art but not everyone will enjoy it,"IN A NUTSHELL:Brilliantly written and directed by Sam Levinson this is one of the very first movies to be written directed and produced during the Covid-19 pandemic! The entire movie was filmed in black and white a visual symbol that speaks volumes making this movie a piece of modern art. The film is already earning Oscar buzz for the film and the actors...all well deserved.John David Washington plays a filmmaker on the night of his premiere. As a film critic myself his characters perspective and comments gave me a lot to think about. He and Zendayas character talk about film love relationships gratitude politics and art.THINGS I LIKED:The fact that this movie only has 2 cast members is extremely impressive especially considering how compelling they are to watch for almost 2 whole hours.Im such a huge fan of John David Washington and thought he was stellar in Blackkklansman. Hes also EXCELLENT in this film. Did you know hes the son of Academy Award winner Denzel Washington? Not surprising. Theres a scene at about the 40-minute mark that was truly amazing. It immediately reminded me of some of the unbelievable monologues his father gave in the movie Fences. It also reminded me of Adam Drivers jaw-dropping performance in Marriage Story. John David also joined the team of producers on this film.Zendaya is only 24 years old and is already so incredibly accomplished in cinema. For being 12 years younger than John David she sure did match his performance in this movie. I felt like she really grew up and gave an extremely impressive performance that puts her on the map. Because the movie was filmed during the pandemic she did all of her own makeup costume design and set dressings. She also joined John David as a producer for the film. In fact she was the one who contacted Sam Levinson to kickstart this project. They grew close during their time together filming Euphoria and continued to collaborate artistically. They all should be very proud of this work.The direction and camera work were artistic masterpieces. Truly stunning.I love that the movie was in black and white. Every frame is immaculate. There is mention of the classic black and white movie Citizen Kane. I think Orson Welles would have been proud of this film.Fantastic one-shot scenes.I thought the references to The Lego Movie movie were hilarious.There are so many insightful comments about cinema. If you watch this movie consider watching it with captions turned on and the pause button in your hand so you can really analyze and savor each flavorful line.The Cee-Lo song that played during the end credits was perfect when he sings ""Theres a fine line between love and hate."" The song is from the Outkast track LiberationYou will feel all the feels especially if youve ever been in a romantic relationship.Word has it that part of this movies story was inspired by when Sam Levinson forgot to thank his wife during his speech at the Sundance Film Festival. Ouch.THINGS I DIDNT LIKE:Some viewers wont like watching a new film in black and white.When the actors whisper to each other its hard to hear what theyre saying.I hate seeing Zendaya smoke ruining the health of her cute body.The constant fighting is exhausting. Sooooo much yelling.I felt like I was being physically assaulted with all of that crude violent language.I wish Zendaya hadnt been in her underwear for most of the movie. Then again I understand the visual portrayal of vulnerability.TIPS FOR PARENTS:You see a woman sit on a toilet and later in a bathtub but her private parts are covered. Later you see her in skimpy revealing underwear.Profanity crude language and sooooo many F-bombsThe ""N"" word is used several times.Kids will be completely bored. Its really NOT a movie kids should watch anyway.Lots of smoking and drinkingTalk of drug use and rehabTalk of sexYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",10.0,858

Queenie04, Exhausting to watch but good!,Im glad I watched this film in my living room with the volume low and not at the cinema.The dialogues were a bit on and off to me. It was a bit hard to keep up at times with all the shouting and swearing. Sometimes a bit too scholar on Maries side like she was reading her lines.That said I think the acting was really good. Enough to keep me captivated during the whole time. It felt authentic.The aesthetic in general was raw and really beautiful.,7.0,866
irentovmasyan, boredom and waste of time,"The film is complete moronic delirium. There is nothing to watch. There is no plot at all: The couple first quarrel then they say that they love each other then they quarrel again and so on for the whole movie. The script is ill-conceived illogical as by the way in the series of the same director ""Euphoria"". Very bad acting of Zendaya and Washington. I generally while watching the film did not believe in their acting. Twisted monologues and dialogues everything looks generally unnatural. Waste of time watching this movie. Very bad job of the director",2.0,867
EponymousMeliora, Dull and petentious,Soooo...where to begin? The plot? Repetitive and identical. The screenplay is built on the model of intensity and drama followed by e scene of relieve and sensuousness. This is just a recipe for a dreary motion picture. The acting? John David Washington is mediocre like always and Zendayas pretentious and galling acting is really the cherry on top of this disaster. The cinematography was nothing special as well. A bad start of 2021!,3.0,868

How was the relationship between them at the end?

chrisdannie, One Person Carried The Entire Movie... Can You Guess?,"I want to start by saying that I LOVE Zendaya as an actress I mean since a child she has had such a cute genuine approach to every single role that she portrays. I mean how many actresses do you know that can go from a drugged out teen to a super hero one? She is AMAZING... But I dont think pitting her up against John Washington in this film was fair on any account. First of all Johns energy throughout the entire film gave a sense of urgency and realism while Zendayas character seemed very performative the entire time. And I understand that her character was meant to be ""weak"" to some extent but during an argument when someone is coming at you with that amount of fire in their words no person in a serious relationship is going to be that willing to just cry and listen. I say this not because he is the son of Denzel but because he carried the role and the movie with such grace that kept you intrigued: He carried this movie all by himself. From listening to his music in the beginning it was so real and honest to the hurtful words he was saying while Marie was in the bathtub even to the subtleness of apologizing to Marie and finally thanking her like she asked it was all open and real. Yes relationships are messy and there is always going to be one person who is the ""dominant"" but Maries character was much to unrealistic in this movie. I feel like it wouldve been much better with an actress who could keep up with Johns energy.",6.0,872

RJBrez, Guaranteed to be under appreciated,I wont need to read many reviews on here to figure out that most people will not like this movie. This is a simple film with a simple premise but its executed to perfection by Washington and Zendaya. The only problem with the movie ? Its being released in 2021 where audiences have the attention span of a gnat. Theres no action or explosions or quotes to hashtag. Its just a story about a couple working through a handful of issues. Some of the dialogue is over the top but most of it is beautiful. Most of all this movie has what most things do not in 2021: Authenticity. I appreciate people taking a chance and being unique especially in our over commercialized culture.Kudos to the very small amount of people who made this movie happen so quickly. Those who actually appreciate the art form will appreciate your work.If you have an open mind check this movie out. Its unique and rewarding.9/10,9.0,878
kiwipeachtastymix, The movie is disappointing,I was excited for this movie but It was a letdown. It was exausting to watch them argue for 100 minutes. Malcolm didnt feel like a real character hes just a self-insert used by the director to adress film critics. It was disturbing to see him throw tantrums just because he couldnt read a movie review.Theres a scene where Malcolm talks about Black directors and racism it felt inauthentic.

augustrose-64273, Amazing! but not for everyone...,Dont listen to the bad reviews and watch this film! its not meant to have an elaborate plot it is simply to show a night with a couple. those saying they had high hopes and were let down by 100 minutes of fighting just did not do enough research on the movie. i knew coming in what the setting of the movie was and its structure. it is not the movies fault you expected a different plot. watch the movie knowing youll be watching an intense night with an unhealthy couple that love each other.,10.0,885

OhDavidMyCaptain, Strong premise. Flawed execution.,Malcolm and Marie is one of those movies that youre happy you watched out of sheer curiosity if nothing else.The premise is a strong one that doesnt seem to go anywhere important but that isnt to say that it doesnt have a moment or two sprinkled throughout its runtime. Its certainly a glorious film to look at and the performances of Zendaya and Malcolm Washington are so captivating that I almost forgot that what I was watching was pretty much pointless.Watch it cautiously. It isnt a complete waste of time but Im sure theres better things to find while scrolling.,6.0,887
onurmems, Dribble,When you base a film on just 2 actors one location and one night the script and actors need to be very good.And here none are. The script is pretentious without having an ounce of quality and the actors cannot do anything to make it better. Washington is not half the actor his father is and Zendaya is only little better but you cannot blame them too much as they have such poor material to work with.The director/writer needs to go back to film schoolBest thing about the film is the musicAnother netflix piece of expensive looking rubbish,1.0,888

julia-d-dimitrova, Beautiful film,"I waited all night to watch this movie.First of all I really like that it is black and white because one can actually concentrate on the emotional dynamics. The whole movie is about those dynamics and in my eyes the way that the actors executed it all is brilliant. I think that all the people that see this piece only as a two-hour fight just fail to see the emotional journey that this film takes us through. I personally as a person that has been in a toxic relationship can really relate to many things I saw.Another thing that i find so good about this film is that you dont know whats coming next. It is not predictable. I also laughed.. but because it was sad.I admired Zendaya before this movie now even more so. John is now also in my favorite list.All I can say to the crew and cast is ""Thank you! I appreciate your work!""",10.0,891

MattD12027, Hateful and exhausting,"This is a beautifully made film with a few scenes of excellent acting... but the script entirely misses the moment and the relationship is both artificial and exhausting at the same time.

I wanted to turn it off three separate times but forced myself to stick it out in hopes of some sort of resolution. Fool me twice and all that...Give this one a skip.",3.0,893
fact-fiction-bvba, MA(L)C(OLM) & CHEESE,I had to stop watching (18 into this er... play) when Malcolm gets himself a second helping of mac & cheese while his bowl is still quite full. Although Malcolm eats like a drunk making way too much irritating noises for no apparent reason he talks like a thespian on stage. Whenever I count more than 3 people with producer credits on a very modest arthouse pic with just two people in one apartment alarm bells go off: in this case there are no less than FOURTEEN producers....,4.0,894
richard-1787," Few movies have held me like this one, but it is often a very painful experience","First so it doesnt get lost in the rest of this review let me make it clear that this movie offers two painfully first-rate performances that will rip your emotional guts out. Ive seen ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" several times and I have to say that this movie is even more gut-wrenchingly powerful and well acted than that masterpiece.It also comes off as a lot more ""authentic"" - a word played with a lot n this movie. While I like WAOVW a lot the dialogue is very often very theatrical. Here while there is also dialogue that sounds as if it is being recited from a stage play - Malcoms remarkable speech delivered half in the kitchen and half in the garden that drops the names of MANY famous movie directors and script writers all at remarkable speed for example - that is less often the case.But this movie also plays with what we perceive to be natural. Perhaps the most remarkable instance of that is the scene where Marie presses the carving knife on the tile floor while truly terrifying Malcolm. You hang on every word of it terrified of what she might do - only to discover that she is ""acting"" making the point - very well - that sometimes you cannot tell when a person is using real emotions to act and when they are just expressing ""authentic"" emotion. Elsewhere in the movie Malcolm describes that as the difference between creating a work of art and just making a video of oneself emoting and then posting it on YouTube.That is brought home yet again at the end when we see that this movie was written and directed by a young white man Sam Levinson a point for which Levinson prepared us during Malcolms garden-kitchen speech when the character asks what two Jewish men David Selznick and Ben Hecht could have had to contribute to Gone with the Wind. (A great deal evidently.)Watching two people who have feelings for each other rip each others hearts out is not fun - though Marie at one point says that audiences love to watch it. But when the script is good and the acting and directing first-rate it is a powerful experience. I strongly recommend this movie but only to those in a good enough mood that it will not drive them into depression.",9.0,895
chrissyhumphreys, This film deserves more love,So much deeper than what people are calling just a couple fighting for 100 or so minutes. Its unique and refreshing and raw and I loved every minute of it. Granted this movie wont be for everyone and I think it will be lost on a lot of people. But if you love movies and I mean truly love them then youll love this film.The acting is incredible and award worthy. The writing passionate and bold and poetic. I think pretentious is used too flippantly when you arent as immersed into a world as someone else. But you dont need to relate to the showbiz part of these characters thats surface level. The complexities deeper in their personalities are what this film is really about.This film is a character study of two flawed but brilliant people and portrayed so cleverly. You HAVE to look deeper than what theyre saying.Beautifully shot. Zendaya is wonderful John is wonderful. This film deserves more love.,8.0,896
gpapakyprianos, a very needed movie as of 2021,From the view of a problematic relationship this movie shows the lack of understanding of forgiving and thankfulness in todays society. Through many outbursts and calming moments it brilliantly depicts the ups and downs of life the human passion the spirit and soul. It gives away a sense of a twisted romance though its more a socially twisted drama.overall a very well shot black and white movie,9.0,897
andreascaloni, GREAT PERFORMANCES,Malcolm and Marie follows a writer-director and his girlfriend whose relationship is tested on the night of his latest films premiere when revelations about themselves surface. The movie has two great performances both from the two main and only characters Josh David Washington and Zendaya. However the story is simple and the film isnt remarkable. Nevertheless it has a good rythm and gives a great opportunity to these two emerging actors.Rating: 72.,7.0,898
stephenstephenbyrne, It's a no from me,This movie made me feel like Zendaya during the first few mins when shes just tryna have a ciggy and looking so unamused as Washington is just ranting in the background.

muelnguyen, Visually beautiful but thats about it,On paper this was set out to be a great success. Two great actors and an original style but it didnt deliver. I thought the visual style was very nice with some interesting choice of shots and visuals. The acting from John David Washington was also quite good I didnt think Zendaya was as good.However the story has no depth. In a film you are supposed to sympathize with characters and go through their journey and change but here I found myself hating both characters. They simply didnt seem like good people so I didnt care for them. They argue over and over about the same thing they swear too much to attempt to add intensity and the story doesnt really take different turns. It feels like a theater piece with musical interludes.If you have a story to tell make a film. If you have nice pictures to show make a photo album.,4.0,904
PaxtonMalloy, What an irony: The director waiting for reviews won't like this one either,The only thing this film has going for it are the tremendous actors. There is no plot the characters are unlikable the dialog is as unnatural as humanly possible and the camera cuts are so jarring that I always constantly notice them which I am not supposed to.Yes relationships are messy. but this isnt a relationship Human beings dont talk or behave like that. They dont give 8 minutes Monologs and psychological Analysis of their partner and yell for one hour and thirty minutes straight. It literally feels like the director said before every scene: Go as big as you possibly can. This is 10 different acting exercises edited together. But it is not a movie.,4.0,905

123123BROCOLLI, People consume movies like a junkie consumes narcotics,This is a great piece both actors gave an amazing performance and it was beautifully written.I am under the impression that most of the bad reviews I read were written by people that are used to the thrill of the usual 3 act movie (hence the title of this review). I also do understand why this isnt a movie that will be liked by everyone still I thought it was the most interesting discussion about race cinema and relationships that I have ever watched on screen.It is more than a movie about relationships there is a lot more hidden in the dialog. It is not a movie to be watched sitting back waiting for drama to escalate between the two characters until the great ending presents itself glorious and full of emotion and absolution.I was really surprised to watch a movie like this on Netflix and I do understand why the reviews are so low since the people on the platform are not expecting this approach to cinema being shown in such a commoditized way.,8.0,907
melvindeondavis, May Have Been Better With A Different Actress,"This movie tries hard to be different and something that pulls you in. To me it falls short on both.The main issue I have with this movie is the casting of Zendaya as the lead actress. Her acting is similar to Brie Larsons. They both are very ""dry"" and boring when delivering lines and both make scenes dull. Zendaya ruined the first Spider-Man film she was in for me with her acting. She is being overly sexualized in this film. She will be forever be looked at as a child to most due to her childish looks. This role should have been played by someone else.The dialog in this movie has powerful messages about Hollywood but the overdone and uneccesary cursing deducts from it. They also say each others names entirely too much.I wanted to like this movie but it was not good at all. Its like the worst of Tyler Perrys and Spike Lees movie styles had a baby together.",2.0,908

Badsharkmoviefan_118, Two people argue the end,That sums up this movie its 2 people in a clearly toxic relationship arguing over dumb things. Ive had more interesting arguments then this up the local pub. I should film myself next time and call myself a movie director. Boring boring boring who knows why I even finished it. This was more painfully to watch then my grandmother dying in front of my eyes. Never again,1.0,910
tim-elisa, Thank you John D Washington,The scenario it definitely different its simple and beautiful. You just want in a few hour know more about this 2 people. About what drive them together and apart. And as you enter in the film you start to laugh with them be worried with them understand each point they make until... the scene of the jealousy of Marie ( when she asked why she wasnt cast). The scene is so terribly plaid that it was even difficult continuing watching the film.So thank you John D Washington for showing us you can be an excellent actor in silence (Tenet) and even in really long monologue (Malcolm & Marie).Finally the point to take a film not always politically was really interesting too.**sorry for my English,6.0,911
coreyjdenford, Meh & Meh,As we learned from 2019s divorce drama Marriage Story a true conversation piece is traditionally between two people theres generally a lot of shouting debating arguing and occasionally theres the odd flourish into serenity. Its often cathartic and quite thereputic for two actors with very good chemistry to vent at each other Marriage Story was successful because of that - one reason why its lead actors walked away with an Oscar nomination each. Malcolm & Marie is less the success story more of a flawed conversation caper though its two leads arent the films main problem as both Zendaya fresh off her Primetime Emmy win for Euphoria and John David Washington whos starting to sound a lot like a young Denzel ever time we see him their performances are solid youll be sold on it just for that alone they have fantastic chemistry almost as good as Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson in the aforementioned Marriage Story. Everything in Malcolm & Marie works the script is good the directing is gold and it receives an A+ in acting but the thing that sinks it is its less a conversation piece about a couple thats on the verge of braking apart more a thesis on how awful film critics can be and even the film takes that into context when it leads into venting about white frustration. But other than that this quarantine written and directed film is provocative and seductively stylish that its such a shame the film is brought down by wrought self indulgence. 3/5.,6.0,912

laurenjfree, Great Performances in a Not so Great Movie,I absolutely love both Zendaya and John David Washington. They both gave phenomenal performances in the film but the plot is where my real problems lie.Movies about relationships and moments in time are amongst some of my favorites. However it has to have more. It has to have the heart that pulls us in and makes us really believe in what were watching. As if we are there watching these characters lives unfold before us as we the audience try desperately to keep their fictional love alive. I live for movies I like that. I wanted to be invested. Malcolm and Marie missed the mark.There were some really beautiful scenes but why was it filmed in monochrome? Black and white movies are fantastic when it serves a purpose. It worked so well in Roma and The Lighthouse BECAUSE IT SERVED A PURPOSE. Rather in Malcolm and Marie it came off as a pretentious student film.The characters had the same arguments over and over again. Although I wasnt bored it felt repetitive. I needed something more to grab onto. I needed a jaw dropping ending I needed to think about when I made dinner and dream about when I went to bed. Alternatively it left my mind the moment I switched off my TV. This isnt a movie im ever going to rewatch and I doubt Im alone in that respect.Im giving it a 6/10 although the weak plot and ranting dialogue deserves less Zendaya and John didnt disappoint. They both really know how to act.I dont know wether to recommend Malcolm and Marie or not. Its all on Netflix so give it a shot maybe youll see something I couldnt,6.0,916
sierrafashion, Just because it stars Zendaya doesn't mean it's good,I honestly love Zendaya shes one of my favorite actress but I was very disappointed when I saw the trailer. I decided not the judge the movie too harshly just by the trailer so I gave it a shot. Its was extremely boring and slow moving. Just because it stars Zendaya doesnt automatically mean its good. It was stretched out way too long. If it was on colorhad more cast membersand was around 30-45minutes or so. I would of liked it much more. The story line is extremely basic and has no appeal what so ever. 3 stars for the ability to stretch out angsty argument throughout 2 people for an hour and 46 minutes and get it on Netflix. If Zendaya wasnt in this I bet this movie would be getting the same rating numbers of KUWTK.,3.0,917

ahk-37714," Not for everyone, but definitely good",This is a film reliant on dialogue and if you cant watch a film with a run time of 100 minutes this isnt for you. But if you are someone you is invested by good writing this film definitely has the right elements. This writing is good but could have been improved but that is purely for some of the dialogue. The acting itself is great the chemistry feels real and very believable that these two actors actually are in a relationship which is very key for the film. For me Washington is that standout he is amazing in this film and definitely shows glimpses of brilliance. Zendeya is good but not better than Washington her character can either be extremely confident or emotional and those emotions can switch a bit too quick which doesnt feel realistic or true to the material. The directing is good and the cinematography is visually pleasing especially for a film in black and white.Overall do watch this film it is worth it the film can feel repetitive but the acting and personal relationship of these characters are investing enough to create a good film.,7.0,919

copperrd, Exhausting Repetition,The relationship of the two sole characters of this film is revealed all in the matter of one long-winded repetitive argument. The black and white picture sets the mood perfectly as the viewers are able to enter the bleak exhausted relationship of Malcolm and Marie. There are several ups and downs as we follow the couple through the night but it is easy to realize this one night mirrors their relationship as an entirety. If youre interested in a good story listen. This film is unique as the actors do not show you their trials and tribulations rather they speak them. Be patient while watching this and do not expect a conclusive ending. With a toxic and chaotic relationship such as these characters it would not be true to put a period at the end of the film as their story is a never-ending exhausting repetition.,9.0,925

saadgkhan," Pretentious, pointless and exhausting",Malcolm & Marie - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Zendaya was phenomenal in Euphoria and I was exciting to see her in her first major solo lead in a movie. However she delivered but the movie is just outright pointless and exhausting. Two people yelling for around 100 minutes playing music smoking and cooking thats all you get. You wait for something to happen but it never does they fight take a break then fight again.John David Washington is becoming bit of a disappointment he was great in BlackKKlansman but since then his boring uncharismatic turn in Tenet and now here with Over the Top performance makes you wonder about his choices as an actor. A good actor should be good in anything regardless of the director but he just cant hold on to his own.Sams Assassination of the Nation was over the top but fun timepass which lead to Euphoria but here he went 2 steps back instead of forward. A pointless dialogue bonanza winning no accolades or appreciation. Good they get to make a movie in a pandemic but its we who have to suffer. Things we do for ZENDAYA!!!,4.0,928
jordan2240, The better move from a Washington this year,My wife and I happened to catch a program on PBS radio where this movie was being discussed and the people (I believe they were critics) who were talking about it absolutely trashed it. But it got our curiosity up so with low expectations we gave it a watch. I guess we just arent as smart as the critics because we both enjoyed it. None of the criticisms the critics made (i.e. overacting stiff acting poor dialog) was valid to us. Im wondering if one particular scene that was rather critical of a movie critic simply ticked the real critics off so they were trying to exact their revenge.Anyone whos been in a serious relationship could likely relate to the feelings the actors portrayed and the amount of dialog they needed to perform was astounding. For us even though the movie featured only 2 people in a conversation over the course of one long night it held our attention. Certainly this film was much better than the most recent one Denzel gave us. Count us among those who enjoyed this.,8.0,929

I thought I wasnt going to like it after about 15 mins in but I kept watching. Im so glad I did!!! I loved it!!! The acting is absolutely phenomenal!! The look and feel is so intense and cold. But the heated chemistry between them sets you ablaze then suddenly youre thrusted back into this cold hard dead end of a relationship with them. And at times you hate them and you love them and you understand why they behave and feel the way they do. Then you realize that you can relate because in some way at some point you are them.

paul-allaer, The thin line between love and hate (but the sum of the parts doesn't add up),"As ""Malcolm & Marie"" (2021 release; 106 min.) opens the couple arrives home late at night after Malcolms latest film has premiered to apparently great buzz. Malcolm is putting on some great music while Marie starts preparing some mac and cheese. As the conversation turns we learn that Marie is quite upset with Malcolm as he failed to thank her in his post-movies speech despite the film being inspired by her drug addiction in a prior life. It marks the start of a looooong evening...Couple of comments: this is the latest project from Sam Levinson best known for the HBO TV series ""Euphoria"" starring Zendaya. When ""Euphoria"" shut down production due to COVID-19 he pitched some ideas for a feature film to Zendaya who eagerly accepted this particular idea. John David Washington equally jumped on it. It all sounded so promising and when I saw the films trailer recently I couldnt wait to see this. Alas something doesnt quite add up. The biggest shortcoming is without a doubt the script. Its just not equipped to provide 1 hr. and 45 min. of in-depth characters. To be clear: there are only 2 characters in the film. The trajectory of the characters is too obvious: from hot to cold to hot again and then to cold again and at some point you just want to yell ""enough already!"". Check out the long monolgue that Malcolm gives upon reading the LA Times review of his new film ""by that white chick"". I mean even John David Washington collapses in the film at the end of that rant from sheer exhaustion! But then there are scenes that are very powerful. So in the end its a bit of a bixed bag and frankly this feels like a missed opportunity. Please note that the film is shot in B&W and features an outstanding soundtrack with choice cuts from James Brown Outcast and many others. It is also noteworthy that this is touted as the first Hollywood film produced and shot entirely during the COVID-19 pandemic adhering fully to the COVID restrictions during the movies production.""Malcolm & Marie"" was self-financed by Sam Levison and his wife (with a minuscule $2.5 million production budget) and then Netflix snapped it up for an eye-popping $30 million. The film was released for a limited theatrical run this past weekend before then moving on to Netflix in the near future. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening: I was the only person in the theater (and the rest of the theater complex resembled a ghost town). I honestly dont know how movie theaters can operate profitably in the current pandemic. And its not like this will change any time soon. Meanwhile if you are interested in a relationship drama or are simply a fan of Zendaya or John David Washington Id readily suggest you check this out be it in the theater (if you still can) on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray and draw your own conclusion.",6.0,935
SimonsRants, Stop. Just Stop,"A pretentious man and a mentally unstable woman fight for almost two hours. Thats it.The cinematography is gorgeous. The directing has its moments. And actors are certainly talented. But my goodness this movie felt like being hit with a hammer in the head repeatedly for its entire duration.After the first 20 minutes I thought to myself ""That was a pretty good short film. I didnt mind that."" But then it kept going and going and going. And the longer it went the less relatable and more awful the two leads were revealed to be.The man is an egotistical and pretentious sort who keeps a list of all the favors he does for his girlfriend and holds it over her head when she asks for anything in return. The woman is mentally unstable and verbally abusive gaslighting and playing the victim in a toxic manipulative way. The way they portray the supposed ""fine line between love and hate"" bears no actual semblance to real life or real relationships - at least not in mine. If your relationship is like this - RUN. This is not normal. This is not okay.Every argument that starts back up again only shows more why both characters dont deserve our sympathy. We do not know anything about either character except what they tell us by screaming at each other over the course of the film. Its exhausting. Its unwatchable at times.I gave this a slightly higher rating at first - a 5/10 - because from a technical standpoint its very well made I just didnt care for the handling of the plot. (Thats not to say I didnt enjoy the idea I think films like Locke are intriguing and Marriage Story was fantastic. This didnt quite do it for me though because... well the toxicity of it all) But after seeing how women of Twitter have responded my feelings toward the movie have soured a bit more. This honestly reminds me of when Fight Club came out and the narcissistic a-holes who watched that idolized Pitts character and turned him into a hero. Now its the turn for the abusive toxic women to have their hero.",4.0,936

Bviruiyan-Chwordervosky, SOON TO BE CLASSIC,"Straight out the gate dont think of it as the black version of Marriage story it doesnt have the maturity of characters nor the same depth of conflict together with the stakes that film beholds. Malcolm and Marie is not pretentiously profound like how other critics try to make it seem it is a beautiful film featuring the outburst of emotions from two unstable lovers with contrasting personalities and we go with them as they go through a night of intimacy intertwined with toxicity. Well-shot and well-directed it looked liked a ""high-end disagreement"" and amidst the pettiness between two lovers their environment blends well with their situation the mood right from start glued me to my screen from start to finish.Both actors did an amazing job and huge part of it is because of the superb writing but I see people criticizing the chemistry between Zendaya and John and I honestly believe Zendaya is a very replaceable part of the film but nonetheless she did great and delivered her best performance of her acting career John is so versatile and honestly he could be a leading man of an another romantic film. This is one of those films where we supervise and go where the characters dialogue take us dont go looking for a huge arc just enjoy and feel the actors performance cause for sure both gave heart-felt acting.",9.0,939
checooke, Revelation,Malcolm and Marie tells us the important yet struggles of a relationship. It is almost as if the movie that Malcolm wrote in the film almost has the same effect on us viewers. Pain  conflict  the passion that was written in the script alll is similar to the movie. I feel as if zendaya did a wonderful job as playing a depresssed drug addict yet intelligent and open minded girl. And John Washington had an even better role playing malcom after seeing his wonderful performance in Tenet. You can feel the tension between the 2 characters and actors. Although there may be some poor comments I think Malcolm and Marie is a revelation too relationships in this day and age and must get more recognition.

Cineanalyst, Who's Afraid of the Film Critic?,"This is a fascinating one to read reviews for including if not especially the ones with which I disagree. I think thats because ""Malcolm & Marie"" is explicitly about the creation and appreciation of cinematic art. The two-hander one-house lockdown set (made as it was during the pandemic) talkfest takes place after the eponymous couple return home on the night of the premiere of Malcolms debut film which he wrote and directed. Their series of monologues--organized almost as if they were part of a formal debate each talking at length largely uninterrupted and each taking time to formulate rebuttals--begin and end over his neglecting to thank Marie herself a former actress turned ""muse"" in his public remarks at the premiere. Another focal point of the couples arguments is an LA Times review of the unseen film-within-the-film. Indeed the review makes some similar criticisms that have been leveled against ""Malcolm & Marie"" over authenticity authorship gender race stylistic choices. Its an argument about artistic values within the film and continued in reviews of it.Im a sucker for this sort of reflexive construction. Initially or instinctively I had the urge to dismiss it though which some others seem to have as an artsy and self-indulgent stagy exercise in overwrought overacting on black-and-white celluloid. A lot like in some ways two recent filmed plays both of which I also liked ""Ma Raineys Black Bottom"" and ""One Night in Miami"" (both 2020). All three are unrealistic and dialogue heavy in their own ways where actors are sometimes playing ideas or arguments more than they are characters and theyre all artistically reflexive debates about art. ""Malcolm & Marie"" however is more cinematically designed than them while in form highly reminiscent of ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (adapted from the play in 1966) with so much attention given to composition and the highlighting of that by its unusual nature as a modern black-and-white film. Its also focused on film--down to the celluloid vs digital debate--whereas the other recent movies are more about music or other media.Regardless of whether this is semi-autobiographical of writer-director Sam Levinsons marriage as filtered through actors John David Washington and Zendaya and all the gender and racial issues that brings up with a white man telling the story of black characters one female within the film the neat suggestion is that its making itself: that its the result of the writer-director character Malcolm and actress Marie having made it themselves--and that it too is about talking about a prior film thats also semi-biographical. Its a multi-layered narrative mise-en-abyme. On top of that the gorgeous high-contrast black-and-white cinematography is often framed through the homes many windows creating another framing within the already-existent frame of the film--a visual mise-en-abyme alluding to the fact that this is a film. I like too how most of the score is diegetic.Of course this review is a reflection of how I interpret the film and approach cinema in general while others may be more interested in discussing character deficiencies the supposed realism or socio-political issues and especially race if they dont dismiss it out of hand as artsy self-indulgent etc. All valid criticisms more or less and I even agree with them in part but every time a diatribe verged on obnoxious or at least exhausting its turned around just as Malcolm and Marie go tit-for-tat in their verbal abuse and then to shared joy breaking for a cigarette now and again in between. I found a lot of it to be quite funny. A film where the two characters unnaturally speak in long-winded monologues as photographed in black and white but which also plays out largely in real time and is so realistic that the camera follows them to the bathroom. Some of Malcolms anti-academic rants also for instance ironically become academic in their criticisms--bringing up race and politics or the male gaze to refute them as if Levinson were defending against accusations made of ""Malcolm & Marie"" even before it was released. Malcolms movie criticized for gratuitous nudity while we see Zendaya as Marie in various states of undress only for Malcolm to point out that if this were a film that could be similarly rebuked. Marie an actress who may sometimes be acting and as played by a real actress has her moments as well especially at one point when it seems as though the lovers quarrel has really gone off the rails. Its not whether its right or who wins the argument or even that the picture is profound or pretentious but its a thoughtful engagement with film on film.",8.0,944

sebastiandevos," Great performances, but fails to hold attention for rest of film",The film is 1hr 45 mins.I really like the first 45 minutes. It was funny well written and well acted and for the most part I was hooked. The black and white looked slick - the cinematography and direction were all really good.However after this theres a 15 minute period where it kinda dips in energy and I started to notice myself checking the time a couple of times.The biggest problem however comes in the final 45 minutes... because they literally just... repeat the first hour. It follows the same format arguing back and forth and gets stale way too quickly than it should. It falls into the trap that other contained films do one where they just kind of run out steam and energy and just ideas of where and how to progress the story forwards. So the end up repeating the same stuff and it becomes unfortunately extremely boring.Zendaya and John David Washington are both good but dont make this film worth watching. At least 30 minutes could have been cut and it wouldve been a lot better but it wouldnt have solved all the issues.Quite disappointing. Couldve been a lot better.,6.0,946

jakemelin1217, Malcolm and Marie,Directed by Sam Levinson and starring John David Washington and Zendaya.One of the first films to be shot over the COVID-19 pandemic this indie film by Levinson is immaculately shot in monochrome. Some of the shots in the film are so well framed it looks like a painting.Washington and Zendaya both give stellar performances working well together with great chemistry.The film focuses on a theme of critics and how film as an art form is perceived by audiences. There is aggressive dialogue towards the LA Times when reviews start to arrive to Malcolm which could be controversial resulting in esteemed critics taking this message to heart.One flaw I have with the film is that as amazing as Washington was in the film there is a moment where he goes a bit over the top and it starts to become a one man show almost.Overall: 8.4/10,8.0,949

emilyerose-53416, An acting showcase,Zendaya (especially) and John David Washington are magnificent! The cinematography and soundtrack are also highlights. Sam Levinsons script is pretty good despite being a bit self indulgent and very meta at times. Nonetheless the lead performances enhance the storytelling plus Levinsons direction is stellar. Highly recommend - this film is not for everyone though thus why its been so divisive critically! I for one very much enjoyed it (cant wait for all the think pieces about this film upon its release LOL - a word to all watch/read interviews about this for greater context please). Its for sure worth a watch anyway if only for the performances!,9.0,951
adamboykin, Like father like son,John David Washington continues to show his dominant and powerful presence as an actor and how prevalent he can be on the screen. Zendaya was not outshined by John David Washington however as she gives a very strong and heartfelt performance. These two actors showed their range emotion and talent incredibly well. The writing could have been really bad if it were different actors in the role however John David Washington and Zendaya made some bad lines seem good purely off their performance and talent.Malcolm & Marie depicts emotional trauma resentment lust fame and heartache in a relationship and the affects it can cause in a fantastic way. Each character has their own monologues about the relationship their life or past trauma or past relationships that brutally hurts the other person. The film shows how all of these things in a relationship are detrimental to both people and how it forms toxic emotional attachment which is unhealthy for both people to be in.Where the film falls short is in the run time. This film is not long it stands at an hour and forty six minutes and towards the end of the last act it feels like it is dragging on and they are arguing or talking about the same thing. If this film were a little shorter then it would have had a better impact on people but the end of the film took so long it kind of makes you not invested. Other than that this film has really good Oscar worthy performances and has really great themes throughout!,7.0,952

RomanceNovelist, Brilliant and doesn't insult the intelligence of the black audience like a Tyler Perry movie,"Im giving this movie a 10 for artistic quality story the fact that it held my attention with only two actors commanding the screen and cinematography. I might have given it an 8 but it scored a bit higher because it gave me a story about black people that didnt mention the typical stereotypical stuff most of us black folks dont identify with like drugs or crime or traumatic topics like police violence slaves or the white savor trope (i.e. The Help or The Blindside) basically topics Hollywood seems to think black people are limited to or care about. I look for stories about black people that dont insult my intelligence like a Tyler Perry movie. No screaming adults or ignorant folks (the language Perry seems to think black people think and speak in). I can barely stomach his movies. I can watch and enjoy a Spike Lee movie who... now that the rest of America is ""woke"" is better understood.Ironically Spike is mentioned a few times so the director may have been thinking of Spike when selecting the soundtrack. Or maybe he was thinking of him when he cast David Washington (son of Denzel Washington who worked with Spike on two of his most important films three total).What surprised me is that a white director could write black characters so succinctly much less direct them without reducing the characters or the conflict to stereotypes. David Washington embodying that young cool black dude swagger and Zendaya in an unexpected role that was sexier than I was used to because I still saw her as a girl rather than an adult. So it took a few minutes for me to dismiss any expectations I had about her age.Is the fact that the entire film is black and white a bit pretentious? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Malcolm and Marie held my attention throughout. Its a long movie but I didnt notice the time passing because I wanted to know what would happen to this couple. I was anxious to find out. Like 2020s The Photograph I enjoyed it. Its a movie for adults.Maybe we can get back to a time when we have more black films with something to say. Even comedy that has more to say and doesnt involve a black man in drag disguised in an insulting caricature of black women. Maybe we can get back to a time where there were movies like Mo Betta Blues Jungle Fever or The Best Man Love and Basketball and a few others that left us feeling a certain way. Malcolm and Marie is ""THAT"" movie in 2021. Good job.",10.0,955
mapasha-44287, Insanely pretentious and boring,"I hate this trend of using black and white as if it automatically means your film is ""artistic."" This movie was insanely boring and I could barely get through it. The acting is also super overrated. They both sucked",1.0,956
dragonfire-46773, One of the best movies during the pandemic,I really loved the movie.We have seen brilliant acting from both Zendaya and John David Washington. They both shine in this movie. The camera work was excellent. The shots and the entire settings were beautifully made.I think this movie does not get enough credit.Some may criticizes the lack of story but eventually it reminded me of an theatrical play.I loved the choice of words in the dialogues. They were well written in my opinion. Somehow very realistic and close to everyday language.You have to watch this movie with an open minded point of view.,10.0,957

lilbit-69496, The male ego,First and foremost this movie is written very well. I can see why its not for everyone. This movie goes in really deep and very detailed. But at the same time it should be relatable if youve ever been in a relationship. But for me what I also picked up on is how fragile the male ego really is. It was very eye-opening to see yourself in some of these fights yourself but also have an outsiders perspective at the same time. Seeing why in certain situations men react the way that do.,10.0,962
anthonyspidell," Acting, Cinematography and the Writing... A++",This movie was extremely interesting. It was thought provoking and the dialogue was beautiful.

may197," It tries too hard to copy the genius of ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf""","The movie tries way too hard to recreate the tension/magic/dialog of the classic masterpiece ""whos afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and fails massively. We watch a mess of a relationship which should have been ended long ago they play mindgames with each other where no one is the winner he is obviously dependent on her she is too immature to leave him. Throughout the whole movie I screamed ""Leave him! Please just go and be on your own!"" in my mind constantly. It was painful to watch at some point.Zendayas performance is stellar John David Washington and his character Malcolm are hard to endure and his screaming fits are incredibly annoying and unnecessary (and way overacted).All in all it did no leave a lasting impression it is nowhere near the genius of Whos afraid of Virginia Woolf...unfortunately.

mariannaserwa, Trying too hard to reference Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut,"Very annoying movie with no plot line and cringe-y cast overacting in every scene. You dont care for them and feel no sympathy whatsoever.The most annoying part is that Sam Levinson seems to think is the only one who has seen movies by Kieslowski or Kubricks Eyes wide Shut and endlessly references them and steals ideas but in the end serving no point and no climax.Zandaya dressed the same way as Nicole Kidman in Eyes wide Shut (a brilliant movie I have seen 20 times with easter eggs hidden along the way unlike this piece of garbage). Levinson referencing the idea of deep conversations and fights in EWS but unfortunately to no result no creative meaning no point. Zendaya peeing in an evening gown in the first scene (hello?! Again Eyes wide shut). But why??? Makes no sense in the nineties this was groundbreaking to show this in cinemas but now?? Nothing interesting nothing new.Ive gotten already pretty annoyed by Levinson using the soundtrack from Kieslowskis Double life of Vernonique in Euphoria like it was completely new his idea without any references. But this movie beats the cake because its fake boring and pointless at least Euphoria had a story to tell. Perhaps Levinson thinks the only people seeing Malcolm and Marie will be teenies from Euphoria treating all his ""borrowed"" ideas as new...Not to mention that the interior and the wide shots from outside the house with Malcolm dancing in the beginning of the movie are a straight copy of Mia dancing to ""Girl youll be a woman soon"" in Pulp Fiction....Most cringe-y scenes: Malcolm eating mac & cheese (this scene will hunt you with its annoyance) Zendaya making weird cringe-y faces making her look like a teenager and not like an intelligent wise adult shes supposed to portray.Sorry to say but as much as I enjoyed Tenet in this role Washington is also just plainly annoying full of himself and not a likeable character...Such a shame.",2.0,967
samratsingraur, Powerhouse Duo!,Sam Levinsons Malcolm and Marie tackles the film industrycritics and the art of film making with curiosity and contempt. A brutally honest love/hate relationship that overwhelms and enthralls with powerful music notes in background. Zendaya and John both deliver staggering dramatic performances that astround and the cinematography is breathtaking. I struggle with rating this film as a whole because of my frustrations with the writing but I ultimately choose to speak positively of it because of the supreme strength of the actors who were able to give this story a sense of authenticity.,8.0,968

PedroPires90, A Tour de Force. If you know what I mean.,➕Makes you think about filmmaking writing but mostly life love and respect.Zendaya with a mesmerising performance. I didnt believe the hype until today (never watched Euphoria). All the emotions are there. She is perfect balancing the right mood for the right moment even with few words sometimes. Its a crime if she is not nominated for Oscars. The same crime they are ready to commit with Lindo.John David Washington is almost as good as her on the best performance of his career. Really great dealing with critics (and wannabe critics like this site is full of) but also with insecurities the creative process and all it takes from you.Kick the ass of politically correctness and old and new critics stereotypes about men women or black people.➖It can feels overlong during the 2nd act.

mattjportch-996-832071, Utterly boring spoilt brats,Im baffled who could relate to this besides annoying rich upcoming film industry yuppies. In a dialogue movie you need to care about the characters and the dialogue needs to be interesting. This has neither! Im perturbed by Washingtons recent movie appeal as he seems to be the same character in every one. 40 mins in I had to eject. And when she walked off for another pee only 10 mins after the first it should have turned into a horror movie. Absolute snooze fest with a director who somehow thinks theyve stumbled across gold. Weve seen movies done like this before only they were good.,1.0,972

I felt like I was listening to a neighbors hour long fight but I could not turn away because it was brilliantly done and I wanted to know how it ended. I love this film. This film has classic written all over it. JDW is a brilliant actor I have been a fan since Ballers. I hope these two do more movies together because this is wonderful. If you have ever had a long conversation or a fight with the one you love you will enjoy this movie. I found myself laughing at JDW when he was fighting while eating mac and cheese and when he was having an argument with himself outside. I will watch this again. This is a classic much like Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf. Great job to Sam Levinson this was a super meaty script. I loved it. More please!!!,10.0,976

The emotions were turbulent.I genuinely do not understand why this movie has so many negative reviews. Yes the concept is similar to ""Marriage Story"" and more but is that really a bad thing? We all loved those movies didnt we?They took it and made a whole new movie out of it. Filed it in 14 days with a 22 person crew and 2 amazing actors who really know what they were doing.Im also happy to see Zendaya in something more mature even though I love her other characters and productions just as much.Really great work!!",8.0,977
Walt48, A WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOF? for the 21st century,Not a film for those who give stars based on explosions car chases or the inclusions of superpowers but an amazingly well-written well-directed relationship film with two performances that are outstanding and nuanced and very interesting to watch. It reminded me in content style and its beautifully film black & white of the 1966 Mike Nichols film WHOS AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOF? if Honey and Nick had not been invited back to the house. The fears and foibles of the two leads are gradually exposed through both intense and comedic scenes that are both thoughtful and entertaining.A lot of hate is being directed at this terrific film which is a total amazement to me.,10.0,978

brooksmurphy-1, Acting through the word weeds of pretentiousness,He wears his French New Wave/Cassavetes influences on his sleeve here too bad hes wearing a pretentious long-sleeved turtleneck. Nepotistic director Sam Levinson did some good work on Euphoria but I have to say the acting was what climbed out of his need to shove every word in the dictionary through their mouths. Same goes with this film although far more self-indulgent and frustratingly hilarious to watch. The acting is good but not good enough to climb out of the word weeds. Opinions?,5.0,981

telmamariapaz, A good movie with great potential that has fallen short,I must say I was really excited to get immersed in this movie as I saw the trailer especially seeing Zendaya had a part in it.Overall the movie is engaging shows an awesome acting and performance the cinematics are on point and the soundtrack is good. For me the win in this is definitely the dialogue that is taken to a very deep yet rational level. You witness the deconstruction of two people analyzing each others points of view and feelings while making a reflection on how they perceive and see each other. Also how those very same perspectives and behaviors affect them.I think it has a different format from the usual and the way it centers on the psychological realm of two individuals battling to be heard and understood makes it very fascinating and intriguing to watch.On the other hand I believe the pace of the movie throws away most of the beauty. It quickly switches between intense/loud and calm with the repetition of these two dimensions becoming exhausting and sometimes dull.The strategic exclusion of some scenes would have elevated the movie and originated a more balanced and gradual development of the plot keeping the spectator interested. This aspect reveals a certain disappointment leaving you imagining what could have been a great movie if the duration was reduced and the events sequence was more harmonious.,6.0,983

julianjoker-01865," Amazing Work from Zendaya, John, and Sam","This film is amazing. The way Zendaya and John did not half ass the scenes kept me from leaving my couch. You can tell the both of them took time to practice and build their emotions throughout the movie. Their chemistry as a couple in this film is top notch; youll think they are in a REAL relationship. One moment you understand Malcolms side of the story. While you can also (and DEFINITELY) understand Maries story.One moment I am amuse in shock laughing sad and understanding of both characters struggles. Sam did an amazing job to balance his screenwriting abilities plotting (directing) and screening each plot. Sam does not skip the storyline. He goes from A B C D and then back to A. I honestly do not understand some of the critics rating the movie low because of the screenwriting.Personally the screenwriting is amazing. Sam balanced the whole movie that happened inside of the house outside of the balconies and the yard. That is not an easy task to fulfill but he did it. The critics just do not get the movie or how love and envy in a toxic relationship works. Malcolm and Marie show this and that is why the critics are praising the acting. John and Zendaya delivered which made the film more enjoyable.Sorry if this is long I must say how I feel (without spoiling too much) of the film. This film is great and I hope Zendaya John Sam and whoever played apart of the film gets accolades for their work.10/10 - Highly suggest to watch it. Also Leave Zendaya and John alone. They are grown adults. I dont care how ""young"" Zendaya looks to be Johns love interest. In real life Ive seen 20 something year olds with guys not even ten years older than them. So stop the fuss.",10.0,985
Harry_Gleeson, I need a lie down now,"Overall Malcolm and Marie is an intense but passionate insight into love and life. The performances from Zendaya and John David Washington are fantastic and it wouldnt be wrong to argue that these are their career best performances to date their chemistry is there for all to see. The film is one dimensional and only takes place in one location but that is enough here at least it was for me. It wont be for everyone but theres a lot to appreciate here about life love and film.

heyyyoliver," Less than expected, but it holds up well","I liked it even though I was expecting a lot more considering I knew who was involved with this film.The camera work was beautiful just as expected from Levinson the acting was good the set design was really good the music was about the best part I think and the writing was fantastic but the f this/f-ing thats and give me a breaks got exhausting at some point. Its supposed to make characters more real annoyed theatrical and to the point I get it but it was like ""less is more"" for the most part.I was getting a 50s Hollywood but also a 70s France feeling during some of the shots which was really interesting and beautiful but also sometimes quite pretentious.For me it was the quirky remarks funny one liners Zendayas middle fingers in the air after proving her point the little things that made it so enjoyable.But honestly I saw someone put this is the ""straight people yelling at each other for two hours"" genre and I dont really disagree.Its solid its worth watching but I didnt necessarily feel a whole lot as the story was unravelling.

relic-91902," Pick your worst moments from Before Midnight, then multiply by 10. You get Malcolm & Marie",This movie is plain proof that great acting doesnt equate to a great movie. Its obvious that the duo are no amateurs in theirfield but it doesnt help if the materials theyre given to work with doesnt correlate or just GETS TOO MUCH.Why didnt it work?Zendaya playing a model slash retired actress and yet having the vocabulary range of Maya Angelou seemed inauthentic. I could understand that from Malcolm a writer but not Marie. It felt like the writer was more bent on showing off his words than actually creating an authentic character.JDW on the other hand wouldve been perfect if only he wasnt so loud all the time. His frustrations got me frustrated and it kept going and going on like a vicious cycle. One question I keep asking is if there was so little material why make it last for 106 minutes?All these mismatches ended up making them sound less of who they were supposed to be and more of a medium the writer was using to vent out his words. Which is funny because isnt that the point?The good acting really came through at various moments but it was always immediately replaced by cringe disconnections due to excessively repetitive expository arguments. The characters never really quite clicked.The only difference between Malcolm & Marie and Before Midnight would probably make Levinson bawl his brains out. Authenticity.,6.0,990
negroswan," Raw and refreshing, but still falls short.",Many reviews found the film boring as it is essentially a couple arguing back and forth for 2 hours but I can appreciate the candid and honest depiction of a real-life couple fight. The black-and-white direction was stunning and allowed us to see the nuances of Malcolm and Maries relationship. However I think this movie tried too hard to be authentic that some of the dialogue came across as pretentious and the film overall fell short of true authenticity. Also I was just not a fan of either JDW or Zendaya in this film.,6.0,991

Malcolms character was pretentious soulless and truly cringing to watch.Be forewarned that the female audience will feel this film in their gut.,4.0,992
Xavier_Stone, Atrociously bad. Bascially 2 people arguing. Horrendous camera work.,"From the first 5 minutes you can tell that this is a movie trying to impress you.

Ok fine I was able to accept it and continued to watch.Then at about the 10 minute mark my eyes started to ache like I was wearing a pair of coke bottle glasses. I paid attention more and realized that the camera is continually 6"" to 12"" from the characters at times. The entire face is filled by the screen when they are kissing. And so on and so on.

mulhollanddriveway, Pretty Darn Good,"To all those calling the film ""pretentious""-- just calling something pretentious is kinda pretentious on your part. With that being said ""Malcolm & Marie"" is a well made beautifully shot film that does fall a little short but thats not such a bad thing. Its ambitious in a good way and it does make some valid points on criticism that in turn made many a professional film critic attack the movie for beating them to the punch (of course it would) which further validates its point. However the films greatest shortcomings lie in its built in claustrophobia that after a while does make the viewer want to go outside for some fresh air (literally).

danybur, Much ado About Nothing,"The young couple of Malcolm and Marie (John David Washington and Zendaya) arrive at an impressive house in Malibu. He is a film maker who has just released his debut feature and everything indicates that it will be a success. She an actress who has had addiction problems. Both will engage in a series of recriminations and arguments.Sam Levinson directs this elegant drama beautifully photographed in black and white and aims to reflect a crisis triggered by that premiere.Malcolm & Marie has no shortage of themes which like theatrical works reveal ever deeper facets of their characters: inspiration in real people and situations (with their permissions and implications) their relationship with critics their belongings cultural and racial and its presumed legitimizing role the link between a director and an actress wife.Malcolm is an outgoing narcissistic and partly resentful character. His character begins very ""up"" and borders on the unbearable and from the beginning marks the contrast with the more introverted Marie who feels displaced.The structure of the film could be summarized as a series of verbal skirmishes in charge of one or the other with successful moments of silence with a virtuous camera direction that seeks to translate the theatrical essence of the dialogues into cinematographic terms.But unfortunately we are not facing ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" far from it. There is something that is not working (despite the good acting especially Zendayas) that hinders the emotional (and also the intellectual) connection with the characters: the lack of dramatic progression and the overly analytical or cerebral nature of the dialogues. and discussions which erupt almost from the beginning and with little incubation time.Finally an interesting metafictional aspect is worth noting: Levinson directed Zendaya in the remarkable series Euphoria with a similar character but in her adolescence in such a way that Malcolm & Marie could be seen in this sense almost as a sequel to Euphoria.",6.0,1001

It involves a director Malcolm(John David Washington) who after the night of one of his movie premieres returns home for dinner with his girlfriend Marie(Zendaya) and the night turns into many things from loud words to passion to hope and doubt. The acting and on screen chemistry between the two is tense and great as both of their emotions spill out as they question their sanity and the meaning of love and their current state of being together. The movie may not be everyones cup of tea still its thought provoking and makes one see how love doubt passion and life all clash in one.",5.0,1002

I dont need to like the people I see in a movie but I need to find something I can connect with or understand their motivation.

rnixon-15663, Malcolm and Marie,Malcolm and Marie202115Director: Sam LevinsonStarring: Zendaya and John David WashingtonOverall rating 64/100Malcolm and Marie is about a director and his girlfriends relationship which is tested after they return home from his movie premier and await the critics responses. I feel very conflicted over this movie there was some excellent moments but the movie for me was weighed down by its significant flaws so lets get started.First of all I loved the cinematography the classic tone the performances and the chemistry between the leads. The movie looked absolutely fantastic the stylistic choice of making it black and white was an excellent choice and the set location was truly beautiful there was just some excellently crafted shots to signify how the characters were feeling in that particular scene I also loved how classic the movie felt it felt like it was made in the 60s or 70s with the credits at the beginning and the soundtrack choices it was really refreshing to see. I do have to say that the performances in this movie were absolutely fantastic they both had heaps of charm and depth to their performances and bought there characters to life in an exciting way showing great nuance and depth to their performance and different layers to their characters that felt authentic and powerful and in general they both had excellent on-screen chemistry and bounced off each other excellently on screen I would gladly see them both work together again.However my first few negatives would be that there were some repetitive plot points there was some oddly set up and just unneeded conflict and the character of Malcolm was not very likeable at all. Due to the movie being very restrictive as it was only set in one location the movie felt very repetitive in places there was a lot of scenes that were just repeated a lot of the time therefore limiting the movies creative shots and cinematography and just making the film feel not as fresh and creative as perhaps It wanted to be. Also due to the limited setting a lot of the conflict within the movie felt oddly set up to me one-minute Malcolm and Marie would really be getting along and then they would walk outside and come back in and start another argument it just made the pacing very clunky for me and some of the conflict within the movie just felt unnecessary and didnt contribute enough towards the overall plot and depth to both of the characters. I also thought that the character of Malcolm was just very unlikeable he said some unforgiveable and nasty things to Marie and considering her mental state and the sensitive topics for some of it Malcolm just came across as nasty and lacked any form of empathy yes Marie said some hurtful things as well but most of the time she justified and explained why she was saying it and how she was feeling. Malcolm came across as cocky arrogant and ungrateful.My final few positives for the movie would be the fantastic script balance to both of their relationships and the key themes within the movie. The excellent character depth and the development of the plot and characters. The script for this movie for me was the strongest part to Malcolm and Marie the amount of depth it went into with its characters was astounding the dialogue was clever and well delivered with some deep themes on the representation of racism within the media and in film as well as certain aspects of news tabloids and film criticism that really made you think. I thought that the character depth and development of both Malcolm and Marie was truly excellent this movie laid everything on the table for both these characters the audience knew every single minor detail to both of the characters and their lives and how they behaved this was well paced out throughout the movie and was an excellent in depth character study of both of these characters. I also loved the balance to both of the characters as well as the themes conveyed to the audience. The movie had an equal balance of showing the flaws to both characters and showing it from both of their perspectives offered a healthy and consistent balance to the movie despite me connecting with and agreeing with what Marie had to say more than Malcolm and having both characters perspectives of the deep themes of the movie was a nice touch offering two different sides to the same issue.My final couple of negatives for the movie that really made it too flawed for me was its dull and emotionally draining tone as well as its unsatisfying ending. This movie was hard to get through having repeated arguing for most of the movie with two characters constantly screaming at each other just isnt an exciting premise or idea for an audience to watch it was emotionally draining and I had to take a break about halfway through if it had more of a balance of the positive side to their relationship then perhaps it could of worked better but with the amount of arguing in this movie it would have worked better as a short film. I also thought the ending was very unsatisfying in terms of both Malcolm and Maries arc as a couple and Malcolms arc. By the end of the movie they should have separated there wasnt any real satisfying closure to their arguing and it just felt like there was too many negative things about their relationship I felt like the arc for Malcolm was also weak he apologised but for three seconds it wasnt enough to make his character likeable and he should have been much more willing to try and change and become a better person for Marie but the audience got none of that so therefore it left me very unsatisfied.Overall Malcolm and Marie boast some great visuals a well-constructed and deep script highlighting issues with the representation or racism and drug addiction as well as news tabloids in great detail as well as having some awards worthy performances from John David Washington and Zendaya. However is too flawed in its repetitive and dull plot that makes it hard to get through and its flawed structure that left me very unsatisfied with both of the characters relationship therefore making the films awards chances very low.,6.0,1010
miguelovargasmejia, Sentimental but not emotional,Most interesting feature of this film definitely is the few resources that it uses to tell the story: just one location and two actors. But despite the film shows many sentimental moments It´s hard that the viewers can identify with the characters. Cinematic techniques are above the tale and the form is most important that the essence.In spite of everything It´s a good exercise for both director and spectators.,6.0,1011
siandrew-57119, Felt unauthentic but visually is stunning,Aesthetically this movie was amazing visually beautiful however it did feel too pretentious and repetitive to be authentic. The acting is incredible from both leads in what unfortunately feels like a sloppy script - arguments felt fake and it lacked passion. I ended the movie with no attachment to either character - normally I get quite emotional at any movie but this just didnt resonate with me at all both characters just seemed annoying and pretentious. Amazingly artistic but I feel it could have worked better as a short film. Also they both said each others names way too much to be real.,5.0,1012
Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews," A Quarantine Double Feature, Part 1: Malcolm & Marie","Remember when you were out in public - when we could go out in public - and you notice a couple within earshot having a ""discussion."" Youre not really doing anything so you get really quiet so that you can eavesdrop on their back and forth. He says something crazy and she has a ready comeback. You lean your ear a bit closer but youre casual about it so they dont notice your nosiness. If its really juicy you may get really lost in it and grab some popcorn but really after about 10 minutes or so youre bored and you move on to your own life. Malcolm & Marie is that but youre stuck listening to the couple argue for almost 2 hours - well after the initial interest has waned. Malcolm & Marie is this weeks big Netflix premiere starring John David Washington and Zendaya in the film produced during last years COVID-induced lockdown. Heres how I found it.Malcolm & Marie was written and directed by Sam Levinson who is the creator of HBOs ""Euphoria"". Shot in lush black and white John David Washington plays Malcolm a director whose latest film premiered this night and was well-received; and Zendaya plays Marie the directors girlfriend who comes home after the premiere with tension boiling within. The film is a series of arguments throughout the night between Malcolm and Marie about art criticism and the various issues in their relationship. A lot of shouting primarily from Washington - monologues pontification and talk and talk and talk all contained in the rooms of this home.First things first Zendaya is special. She really can infuse her characters and lines with feeling and energy even when they dont deserve it. Marie is a fine character but theres not much to it but a sparring partner with Malcolm. Zendaya does her best to give it more and succeeds most of the time. Malcolm is a self-centered egomaniac and Washington plays into that well enough. The problem with Malcolm is that there is so much talking and shouting that it becomes unbearable. Why is Marie even still there?Secondly interspersed through all of the talking are some good music cues. The music gives a good respite to the arguing but it also is supposed to fill in some of those emotional gaps. It is used well and not overdone. The real problem here is that theres no urgency to anything these people talk about. Hes screaming about his movie and the critics and blah blah blah even as shes trying to get him to acknowledge her feelings. I was wondering throughout Malcolm & Marie do I care? When will this be over? And are these people still fighting? The arguing was just exhausting and not in a good way.Ultimately theres too much talking and the subject matter of the argument is not interesting or emotionally fulfilling. This is an argument that youll want to check-out of early. Even though Zendaya does her best I only give Malcolm & Marie one popped popcorn kernel and find something else to stream.",4.0,1013
mgmckenna, Monotonous. Felt like it was 3 hours long,I love the work of so many who were part of this film and couldnt wait to watch it. Unfortunately it just didnt quite.. work.There was no movement no progress. Maybe thats the point but it just felt so tedious to sit through. I have no problem with slow pacing but getting invested in this relationship felt like work.

sparrow3223-159-287038, Not a Flick but a Film,Not every movie has to have aliens or monsters explosions or superheroes. Which is obviously what the general public has been conditioned to believe by a few large mega-corporations within the industry.This movie calls back to the early 60s independent arthouse projects when they wanted something less surreal or abstract to draw in more people. It harkens back to scripts from the likes of Ibsen and on that note can easily be translated to stage.The acting is top-notch the language is hard-hitting and the cinematography is beautiful. It shows that art can easily prevail through even the worst pandemic. It has been done before better and it will be done again better in the future but with that being said this is NOT a film to overlook.,8.0,1018
pronitmallick, Only Acting and Cinematography,Malcolm & Marie is a movie that starts with the fine performance of both Zendaya and John David Washington and also ends with it without anything special in the middle other than the performance. The story that this movie delivers us is the one on one conversation between the two actors. Both the actors put all their dedication behind their performance which makes us wanna grind those scenes. It makes us wanna watch their performance again and again considering the fact that how well its made. Screenplay needed some work. One thing that really struck the presentation of the movie is the cinematography and the grayscale tone was a big part of it. In the end the way this film is made not everyones gonna like it but those who will they are gonna watch it again and again.,6.0,1019
scorpiogemini, Very uncomfortable. Lolita vibes,"Zendaya may have been 23-24 years old while shooting this movie but she still looks very young like a teenager at best. She was not a good cast for this role as it was very uncomfy and distracting watching someone looking like a teenager being intimate with a 40 year old looking man. Lolita vibes. I guess Zendaya wanted to be taken more seriously and get more ""adult"" roles. Its her choise of course.",1.0,1020

chandean-69762, Malcolm & Marie 2021 Review,Malcolm & Marie is an extremely intimate and exhausting (in the best way possible) film.The whole runtime is filled with pretty much one huge argument with some breathing room in between. It was very engaging and was carried heavily by amazing performances by both John David Washington and Zendaya.Malcolm & Marie also has some pretty gorgeous yet simple cinematography combined with black and white coloring that just made the film feel weighted down and emotional.Yes this film is really just one huge argument with no big plot. But its simplicity and beauty is really what makes this film shine.,8.0,1025
roel-willemsen," Flawed, just like the characters",Malcolm & Marie follows an extremely simple premise of a filmmaker and his girlfriend coming home after the premiere of his movie and then proceed to argue for almost the entire night. There are a couple of things to unpack here.First of all the positives.Both actors deliver. John David Washington is oustanding and continues his run of excellent performances over the last couple of years. His character is very expressive and intense and you can clearly see hes all for it.Zendayas star is still rising and she also delivers in a genre that has up until this point been uncharted territory for her. Her character leaves a little to be desired at the start where she seems somewhat monotone and held back but she later gets her moments to shine and totally nails them.The relationship between the two characters portrayed by these actors feels and seems authentic with all manner of genuine relationship issues being covered and discussed.Theres also John David Washingtons rant on how contemporary movie reviewers tend to look for things that arent there in movies and try to make everything political which I just liked.There are some issues I feel like I have to address.The movie feels too long and most of that has to do with the dialogue.There are quiet moments but the movie is otherwise stuffed with dialogue. The movie follows a pattern of a constant back-and-forth between the two leads with long speeches or rants given by each one at a time. Theres some impressive acting here but this schtick does get repetitive and is not as interesting or poignant as its supposed to be. The dialogue is furthermore very exposition heavy which is logical given that the movie largely plays out in real time and we dont get to see any details about the characters past. Also the script makes use of a lot of big words and some very coherent sentencing which to me makes the whole conversation feel a little too fabricated.Theres also the fact that the movie is shot in black and white which honestly doesnt really add anything. The camerawork and editing are still very much done in a contemporary style so the supposed authenticity one is meant to gain from shooting in black and white is somewhat lost.All in all the starts deliver but the movies premise and execution are just not that interesting or innovative. 6 / 10,6.0,1026
javah-88013, My time is more valuable...,I feel like I wasted valuable time watching this movie. It did nothing for me. JDW was all over the place in this movie. Sometimes it even came off as he was rambling. Zendaya tried to hold her own but there was no chemistry between her and JDW. I dont know what the movie was trying to accomplish by doing it such a short time and by filming it during the high of the pandemic. You will have more questions of why after watching this movie.If your a person that hates to argue ...you will hate this movie. It will be cringing to watch. FYI,4.0,1027
peet-56467, 6/10,The story started with black and white cinematography and good camera movements its nice for me. The conflict of the story is clear and the conversation is good. The characters are clear and the chemistry between the leads is so good.

I didnt liked it cause Zendaya looks too young for Washington it seemed that it was no chemistry there ...But as long the movie progresses  its easy to see how mature Marie is and how childish Malcolm is making the perfect match! The arguments are so valid for each part! Its totally understandable than no one wants to give up in a discussion ever.

getpablo-80944, Ghosts of Sam Levinson's past,"Seems like the screenplay for this movie resulted from the aftermath of several therapy sessions Sam Levinson might have gone to.The acting is fine except for the fact that Zendaya looks too young to be JDWs wife and I find it difficult to believe people would actually use such complicated words in the middle of an argument.Overall it is a fairly boring movie about two people arguing but what really irritates me is the use of black and white. It is pretentious and pandering to the extreme as if to say ""Look this is a deep movie about the underlying friction between two people who love each other and its shot in black and white so it is awards material"".Watch it if you have nothing else to do or if you like Zendaya and/or JDW or you are curious about the movie (all three reasons I watched it). I hope you come out with slightly better opinions of it than I did.",3.0,1031
gcarpiceci, Beautiful and insightful,If you are a plot-driven person you are likely to get bored to death by this movie essentially because it is shamelessly plot-less.If instead you are intrigued by the functioning of the human psyche by the dynamics of human relationships by the impact of emotions and of their expression (or lack thereof) then youll probably like Malcolm&Marie .From a cinematographic standpoint the movie is sustained by great screenplay and dialogues enacted by superlative acting; so much so that the whole thing might look at times as overdone hence self-indulgent and self-conscious. But honestly this is an aspect that seem to be annoying for the critics more than for the public.Reality is that I found the movie aesthetically beautiful and also quite insightful.,7.0,1032
MarcoParzivalRocha," It's a masterpiece? No. But still, you will be pleased","After the premiere of his debut film Malcolm and his girlfriend Marie have a deep talk about their relationship.A good example that a low budget film by Hollywood standards can work in our current days.The main focus is on problems that are transversal to almost all couples except for one matter or other and criticizes the film industry slightly as a footnote.The biggest problem is the repetition which turns the narrative into a snowball of the same arguments over and over again but with different words making the viewer question and think like ""I saw this 30 min ago right?"".The performances are very good I really like both especially Zendaya even when she loses the characters momentum and drags her misery for too long.It fails when it tries to take a meta path but still gives us interesting notes for reflection.",7.0,1033
Felixhug," Thin on substance, otherwise great","It reminds me in concept at the trilogy of the ""before"" movies with Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy.While those three movies are amongst my favorites of all time Malcolm & Marie Does not quite deliver on that level.I love the actors the black and white film material the architecture the camera. Stylistically its great. The actors do a solid job too.Unfortunately the substance of the conversations is not really that interesting for a longer movie. As a short this could have worked but contrary to the ""before"" series where chemistry flow and depth of the conversations really blow your mind and you get moments of relatebility in this movie you get a message of fragility and brokenness but beyond that is very little intellectual or emotional stimulation.Also after a while the constant swearing gets on your nervs. I get that they are fighting but the overuse of the swear words is weakening the dialogue and its impact.Just not enough there but i still applaud and love the efforts.Very talented trio at work but the material is too thin the dialogues not sharp witty or observant enough to make it interesting.",6.0,1034

Avwillfan89, Pandemic Cinema,Lockdowns can do many things. Highlight tension force you to pick up a new hobby look within yourself and see all of the ugliness bore you out of your skull or make you appreciate yourself and others around you more.This film seems to contain all of these elements. Malcolm is a filmmaker who returns home from a premier of his latest film and Marie is his girlfriend who sullenly makes him Mac and Cheese. She becomes gradually and increasingly upset that Malcolm didnt thank her in his acceptance speech. It transpires that she is a recovering drug addict whom Malcolm partially based the lead character on in his new movie.As a play this probably would have worked better. As a film its way too long. The characters go constantly back and forth with their arguments their anger and their frustration playing off each other. Making up and then not making up and vice versa.The performances are very good and Zendaya proves her serious acting chops in this one. But sadly its not enough to make up for how boring the film can be at times.,6.0,1043
enyakvarantan, Shallow and streched,As said in other reviews the acting was not bad. Though at times it really didnt seem genuine it was probably a results of the poor writing. I dont believe anyone speaks with such eloquence in real life especially in a fight where your emotions take over. It is a shame as this could have been a potentially good short film. In addition the scenes were stretched to the point they didnt make sense anymore. Malcolms entire rant about the review was too overdone and it felt like the writer only tried to make every scene longer to get to a two hour film. Also I feel as though the writer tried to hard to come across as artistic and original and made it seem very fake. All in all it is watchable and a good way to see what mistakes to look out for when writing a script.,5.0,1044
seemingly_reel, Failed to Impress - Lackluster Writing,"This movie failed to impress me. If you like a bit of plot surprise and prefer that the characters subtext is somewhat veiled beware. The writing is a tired loop which tortures the viewer with its obsessive relentless details. The pacing was also stagnant.Malcolm and Marie is written and directed by Sam Levinson who has done some episodes of ""Euphoria"" which I really liked. But this movie feels like a vanity piece which is straining in a ""cool"" way to be relevant to Black people. Or maybe he is trying to show that all races of people have the same type of arguments.One ironic thing is that part of dialogue refers to film critics but Levinsons redundant dialogue is as bothersome as the character who is irritated by critics. Who knows maybe this ""picture within a picture"" is intended. Or perhaps one of the directors goals was to emulate the filmmaker John Cassavetes who so lucidly revealed the raw complexity of human interactions.I did appreciate the commitment of the actors (although several scenes were overacted by JDW). There was lovely cinematography and production design. But these elements cannot rescue this. At about the 30 minute mark I found myself literally shaking my head while groaning aloud ""oh no"".I hope that Zendaya chooses her projects more carefully. She deserves better.",3.0,1045
vjnambu, Watch it for the lead,Filmmaker Malcolm returns home with his girlfriend marie at night after the premiere of his film. Marie is pissed with Malcolm because he didnt thank her during his speech in the premiere and thus starts the argument between them and we get to know their interests aspirations fears and various trials and tribulations their relationship went through.There is only john and zendaya in the film and the whole film runs on their shoulders. Their chemistry is amazing. Zendaya looks sexy and breaks her girl next door image. Its completely shot in black and white.But the plot was suitable for a 30 minutes short film than a 96 minutes feature film. Its shot exclusively in a house during lockdown so the dialogues take the movie forward. Some are good but some are felt never ending.On the whole if u r a fan of john or zendaya then u will like Malcolm and Marie.,8.0,1046
Zeke_S, Great Performances. Terrible Pacing.,An excellent performance from Zendaya which combined well with John David Washingtons. Although Sam Levinsons directing and ability to write compelling and intriguing dialogue are unquestioned the pacing and overall story of this film are at times completely lost and makes you wonder what the story is attempting to show. However offset with the beautiful visuals it can still come off as a powerful and emotional drama. 6/10.,6.0,1047
gg2507," Great acting, terrible pacing",Acting is on point both performances are very strong and believable. Cinematography is also great.BUT the pacing is terrible. It would have been an amazing short but theres not enough going on to justify its 100 minutes. The conversations become repetitive with the characters talking about the same subjects for too long. They keep coming back to the same issues and fighting and making up and then fighting again for THE SAME REASONS. Also Malcoms monologues are very unatural to me (not an acting issue but more of a script issue the words he use the whole structure of the speech is just not realistic).In the end this left a strange taste in my mouth. Analyzing the scenes separately youre able to fully enjoy the performances from the talented leads but watching the movie as a whole you just get...bored.,5.0,1048

If you enjoy watching other couples fight and argue you might love it. Thats what it feels like... like youre a fly on the wall of a 1h 46m fight. I think this wouldve made an excellent short but its simply way too long.My advice??? Watch about half an hour and skip to the end.,6.0,1052
tonyfp, Misunderstood,In my opinion this film is not as much about the relantionship as i first thought.I feel like their relantionship problems are what keeps the film interesting for most spectators but the the directors true objective was to critique some things about the film industry and specially the way they are perceived. The points made are really good and gave me a new perspective so i really enjoyed that side of the movie.The writing was too eloquent making the fight a little bit unrealistic. I feel like that was a sacrifice by the director as he wanted to make his points very clear and in a normal fight no one woud be able to make such points so clearly.In conclusion it is not an easy movie to digest as it can get a little bit too repetitive. It is worth watching nevertheless as it makes you think and also keeps you curious all throughout the movie.,7.0,1053
thevision-44664, Malcolm and Marie: Movie Review,If it werent for the first 50 minutes and some brilliant performance throughout by the leads i wouldve given this movie less than this.The movie is... i dont know what this movie is really. Sam Levinson was just trying to create a dramatic art. Sure it has drama a lot! Sure it is artistic in a way but what happened after the first 50 minutes? If you noticed the movie watched the movie the way i did youll see when the movie started to fall apart.The first half of the movie genuinely hooked me up to watch a new type of Drama. The acting is Brilliant its superb. Washington and Zendaya are at their best here. Just classic. I wouldnt even mind if they get multiple nominations or even wins.They essentially gave the tone gave the movie that Dramatic Feeling.But after some time it was okay to leave the cycle of repetitive arguments. But the director didnt. The movie is just like: They fight a lot they start cuddling and love they fight again they start making love again the again fight and sooooo on. It became annoying at a context that i had my earphones in my ears movie playing on my laps in phone but my concentration was on my doggie. I was playing with him while the movie was running in back. I wasnt even interested at a point that what would happen now. The way the first half first 50 minutes opend it was really brilliant. I really loved them and also thought that the movie would be a great ride. But after that it just became boring and annoying. There was no point of the movie. Levinson didnt focused that the movie had to go somewhere to achieve a satisfying climax. But instead just kept the arguments on the core. At the end the climax the conclusion was sooo unsatisfactory. It made me thought: What was the point of the movie? What just happened? Are there sooo much convolutions and misunderstanding in a relationship? I really dont think so.. and if yes HOW? LOL the movie made a joke here. All i wanna say after the first BRILLIANT half the movie missed the execution and potential. I was even ready to see a Brutal or Negative outcome at a point. But NOTHING HAPPEND IN THE MOVIE! I was bored as hell.. even the arguments which felt nice in the first half became boring and sooooo long afterwards. I wasted my 1 hr 40 mins of sleep. And had to wake up my dog just to pass the time.,5.0,1054
stefstars, Makes Good Points but Dragged Out,"Im in the middle when it comes to this film. I appreciated the format its done in. I have understood this was a last minute decision since this was one of the productions affected by the pandemic. Its done like a play a format you dont see often in recent movies. It reminded me of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in terms of the way it was filmed with elements of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? Its a movie where you have to pay attention to the dialogue to know whats going on. However as much as I like that they chose this format I dont think it worked out for them and the repetitive dialogue doesnt help either.I like the points it brings up about movie critics who use their critiques as a way to show off their college education sometimes making connections that arent present for the sake of appearing oh so intellectual. Obviously this struck a nerve with the Los Angeles Times since they panned this movie and mentioned the reference thats made to them in their critique. Both characters mock the little ""white girl"" movie critic from the LA Times who is bent on appearing ""woke"" in her critiques yet is just as (if not more) racist as the critics on the other side of the aisle. I loved these observations that were made in the dialogue I agree with many of them. My only issue is that they can be dragged out to death and Im not sure if thats to fill up the movies runtime but I feel that some of it couldve been cut back a bit. Malcolm in particular is the character that can stay talking forever about one subject. One scene that comes to mind is after hes read the ""little White girls"" critics review on the LA Times website and he goes on a whole rant about how these type of critics add to the race problem rather than solve it. They complain about the white savior trope by playing the role of the white savior themselves in real life. Very valid points but Malcolm stays on this tangent for way too long to the point that hes very repetitive.Some of the lines Malcolm and Marie are made to say dont sound natural they sound like spoken essays. Which is ironic considering they both discuss how cringe it is for movie critics to feel the need to flex their college education by making everything sound like a cultural studies essay. The main conflict in the film is that Malcolm forgot to thank Marie in the speech about the film he just released which is loosely based on Maries life and her struggles with addiction. We go back and forth between the two protagonists arguing whos the problematic one in the relationship. Infidelities are revealed character analyzations are made Mac n Cheese dishes are made on this hectic night. Who wins the arguing in the end ? No one. Personally I sided with Marie throughout the whole film cos she definitely was the smarter one between the two and definitely deserved at least a small nod in this dudes speech since its obvious that she was his muse regardless of the other struggling addicts hes met.In terms of acting both do a pretty good job. I felt John David Washington kind of tried too hard in some scenes. A whole lot of yelling on his part to play the frustrated/ misunderstood director and boyfriend. Zendaya on the other hand is more subtle and her gorgeous expressive face says more than any of the lines shes given. Maybe Washingtons yelling and Zendayas coolness is supposed to balance it out but because of the fact that this movie drags on that balance gets lost. All in all the play format didnt succeed with this film because the dialogue was repetitive. A point was made 3 scenes back and its brought up again but with no new insight to offer. Its hard to have any form of attachment with these characters I did with Zendayas Marie but for the general audience I dont think you care whether they stay together or not or whos right or whos wrong the movie goes nowhere. I see what the director was trying to do but it just didnt work out. This movie couldnt survive in the play format those other sets and characters were needed to really let this story come to life and do these characters justice. If the script was revised and cut back I still dont think the movie would have succeeded the way it is now. Perhaps they shouldve waited until the pandemic was over to continue working on this film.Right now its just a writing outlet on the screen for the director where he let his inner battles and thoughts loose with a couples story in the background.",6.0,1055
inker-13614," Almost unique, almost very good",So I was kind of excited to see this film. I think Zendaya was great in Euphoria and John David Washington seems to have a good talent. Also I was intrigued by the fact that the movie was in black and white.From the beginning to let´s say somewehere in the middle of this film I was invested in it I listened to the dialogues carefully and enjoyed most of it. But then I just couldn´t keep my attention anymore and the movie became so very repetative for me. And yes I mean it repeated itself over and over again. All the points they made it was repeated.The vizuals were nice the acting was okay. But I couldn´t bother with its content anymore with the back and forth between the two characters so just spaced out totally and at the very end I really couldn´t wait for it to end already. And that right there is just not a good enough movie for me that it makes me wish it would end. The movies I love I watch them over and over again and fully enjoy every minute even the longer ones.So I give it a 5 out of 10 because acting was okay vizuals were nice and the theme of it had potential and I could relate to some if it. I just really really wish it would have been a bit more exciting thought provoking and not so repetative.,5.0,1056
anthonygiancola24, It's Fine,Malcolm & Marie is the newest film from Sam Levinson produced during Quarantine and starring John David Washington and Zendaya. It takes place over the course of one night and details a fight between Malcolm an up and coming filmmaker and his girlfriend Marie. The argument stems from Malcolm forgetting to thank Marie in his speech before his films premiere.Its an excuse to showcase John David Washington and Zendaya as performers. Two performers who I have lukewarm feelings about to begin with. Both are good in the film but the acting is very stage-y. It all does feel like a play but after like ten minutes I just accepted the style. They work well together and have pretty fun chemistry. In fact both are so good they almost distract me from the glaring weaknesses of the script.I will say that for the first part of the film I was really digging it. The low-fi aesthetics with the quick snappy dialogue really put me in the mood. The main issue of this film is that it is a one location two character movie. Neither the location nor the issue between the characters are dynamic enough to sustain the momentum the film is going for. What really sucks is since there is a restriction of time and space we dont get to see anything of this relationship outside of this one hour. Not saying that you need that but it might help let us in to the argument a bit more.Taken as a whole Malcolm & Marie is an interesting experiment that I dont think fully pays off but there are some strong elements. I think this subject matter deserves a better film and maybe one day well get it but for now? This is fine.But I have to ask: what has happened to Sam Levinson? The provocateur the rebel the absurdist. The guy who made the truly bonkers pop-satire Assassination Nation and staged that breathtakingly gorgeous carnival sequence in the fourth episode of Euphoria? Why has he been replaced by this stoic self serious drama mama just bleeding my time with these emo dirges? Its almost as if Levinson refuses to acknowledge his own artifice trying to trick you into thinking that his characters are deeper and more complex than they are.,6.0,1057
rbvs, Human beings are complicated,"The intricacies of emotions that erupt while yearning for love and understanding can be a roller coaster ride. ""A Marriage"" was another recent film that pursued deeper examination of relationships within the confines of the human condition. This film left me wrung out in that very satisfying way that ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Wolff"" did and in the way that only exceptional writing directing and acting can.Criticized for being overwrought I believe that overstatement is sometimes a device that vaults the ordinary to the exceptional. Zendaya and Washington carry their weight with admirable prowess.",8.0,1058

tallulahdenyer," Tedious, titillating and turbulent","Malcolm and Marie is a pulchritudinous realistic but suffocating film about an ostentatious navel-gazing filmmaker (John David Washington) and his recovering addict relentless girlfriend (Zendaya) that come home after Malcolms (Washington) first movie premiere. During the film the couple toxically argue over and over make up tease the audience with a sex scene and Marie (Zendaya) exhaustingly and frustratingly starts arguing with Malcolm again. Its a cycle that becomes more monotonous every time it begins. Within half an hour it becomes conspicuous that this is going to be the entire narrative. Despite this cinematically it is beautiful and unique in appearance and has that quality of a ""film having a heart"" to quote Malcolm. An excellent film for filmmakers; but a tedious one for everybody else.",4.0,1060
diogobulhosa," We get it Sam Levinton, you can name a lot of Directors.","Over the past few years a black and white movie trend has been unveiling itself. ""Malcolm and Marie"" is a modern-day love story written and directed by Sam Levinton starring Zendaya and John Washington. Fully shot in black and white and accompanied by some great pieces of jazz it unfolds into an unsettling discussion about adulthood Hollywood racism sexism and love.The film begins with a questionable opening scene and although it does its purpose introduces us to our main characters main topic and the set it feels empty and somewhat senseless. Malcolm a young and upcoming filmmaker who has just premiered his first positively criticized movie and his partner Marie a failed actress that ended up becoming a model and has a very shady past after some drug-related problems earlier in her life. Both set the mood for a strong heart-to-heart argument between them that lasts the whole movie. Zendaya worked with Sam Levinton in his successful streaming show ""Euphoria"" and John had just recently worked with Cristopher Nolan in his 2020 blockbuster ""Tenet"".As I see it the movie is an authentic acting challenge. Two actors filling the screen for almost two hours is astonishing and something to take into consideration before criticizing the acting. With that said Zendaya was by far superior to John Washington. Just like in ""Tenet"" John Washington takes too long to adapt himself to the movie and only half away thought it he levels with the amazing actress that Zendaya is. But above all I believe blaming the actors would be unfair. The argument is to say the least horrible. Its pretentious and wants to be so much more than what it needs to. Sam Levinton must have some trauma with critics and although some truth about the Hollywood world is in fact said most of it feels like the writer wanting to show how much more he knows about cinema than his critics. There is no doubt in my mind that this movie was pressured to hit the one hour and forty-five-minute mark.As far as cinematography goes the camera work is mediocre with some very interesting shots but nothing truly beautiful until the very last five minutes where there is a game of mirrors that I am yet to understand which creates a brilliant shot. This is also followed by the last plan of the film which fits perfectly with the black and white and ends the movie in a beautiful style. The music is very good with some very interesting choice of tracks apart from in the opening scene where the jazz tune is in my opinion out of sync with the camera work. Saving the most important for last the black and white. Does it make sense? Yes I believe the black and white is used to emphasize the two characters the two personalities that argue throughout the movie and reveal themselves to us and that is in fact a very good idea and something that I enjoyed. In spite of this its so badly done. When you watch movies like ""Roma"" or ""Cold War"" you marvel at their black and white its truly beautiful. But in ""Malcolm & Marie"" it just disappointing. Its empty and brings no impact to the movie. Once again it seemed to me that it was just another pretentious move by Sam Levinton.All things considered it was an average movie a bold and very challenging concept from Sam Levinton that could have been a cinema milestone but in the end it does not surpass mediocracy.",6.0,1061

Zendaya attracts me to almost everything and I will watch because of her no matter how bad or good the movie is. The acting was A+ the story is like any real life couple. Going around in circles when arguing being redundant. That was how the movie was however it showed real life and real relationships. It shows how much people can be petty. Zendaya is true art she is a masterpiece. She made the movie special. The greatest actress of all time.,10.0,1064

Similar to ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" the action happens in one place centers on a couple and zeros in on their insecurities. Only people deeply involved and intertwined are able to home in so devastatingly. The film is carried deftly by actors John David Washington and Zendaya. The material is sophisticated and raw and the dialog delivered is perfect pitch. The contemporary house is the perfect setting for this story. I love the high note and energy of the first scene and watching Washington dance to James Brown. Zendaya is more than a pretty face as an actor she is a force to be reckoned with. They both are! The music throughout was carefully chosen and felt so right. Director Sam Levinson keeps the action and story moving and for me not a false note was played.",9.0,1065
sofiapanicker, Expectations Vs Reality,"I was excited for this movie -- I think we all were. I have loved Zendaya since I was a kid and even more so in the last couple years as shes made her transition into more mature roles. John David Washington showed real promise in BlacKkKlansman and I think he is well on his way to making a lasting impression in Hollywood beyond his fathers. Sam Levinson has proven himself to be an excellent writer and creative presence with HBOs Euphoria especially in the most recent bridge episodes.Malcolm & Marie had everything going for it so what the hell went wrong?Ill preface by saying that the acting and cinematography are the films strongest elements. People can say whatever they want about the age difference between the two leads (even though there have been much larger ones in other movies and Zendaya is a full-grown adult) but its very clear that they both gave their all to the material. Black-and-white aesthetics are my kryptonite when it comes to film and the intimate setting of Malcolm & Marie allows for that choice to feel warranted. Its eye candy in every sense of the phrase.Malcolm & Maries issues lie mainly in its script. The emphasis on monologues was definitely necessary to drive the plot forward but unfortunately theyre not always effective. A story this contained should rely heavily on its writing yet there are too many moments when what the characters are saying feels pre-packaged. I couldve lived with the two people the film follows being unlikeable and graining if the screenplay did a better job at making the audience care about them. This script was written in less than two weeks and it shows.I wanted to love this movie. I was even ready for it to snag a couple Oscar nominations. But this aint it. Itll be forgotten about because sadly too many other movies have done a story like this better (see Richard Linklaters ""Before"" trilogy). The worst part is this is one of those films that believes its greater than it really is -- its the kind of pretentiousness that you can feel as youre watching. I had high hopes for Malcom & Marie and while it has its moments they are few and far between.Because this movie was so divided among critics I suggest that you watch it if youre interested and form your own opinion. If not then I dont think its worth your time.",4.0,1066

Its all about the ""Why"" with this movie. Zendaya (who i feel is a very very underrated actress) delivers a top notch performance. She shows her true versatility as an actress. Meanwhile JDW is really coming into his own (although at times if you close your eyes you hear his Dads voice he seems to be the next up and coming actor).

It was so real and present for the way we as audience could dig into the souls and emotions of the two main characters.I do believe that Zendaya is one of the best contemporary actresses but nine star out of ten because I felt she was too young for the role. Dont get me wrong knowing that she was there was one of the main reasons I wanted to watch this movie but it took me a while to accept her character and really enjoy the narrative.It was a rollercoaster of emotions and pain pain that I felt mostly for Marie than for Malcolm.

blaxblew, Malcolm and Marie is a Brilliant Adult Film,Malcolm and Marie is absolutely brilliant. I think many people arent accustomed to this type of an intelligent film written for Black people with Black actors especially today. Dont @ me because I SAID WHAT I SAID. Were used to lowbrau predictable nonsense that doesnt challenge the acting chops of the subjects. This is an extremely grueling film of a couple that rips each other apart emotionally like so many of us. These two dont like each other even though they think theyre madly in love. Theyre just mad. Foaming at the mouth mad.The cold exacting bitterness the draws blood almost every time they look at each other out of bed harkins back to Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). More recent Clive Owen and Julia Roberts in Closer.Malcolm thinks hes in love with someone who has not learned to love herself because of her past. At the same time he only loves her when shes adoring him. Then she loathes him because she doesnt believe he sees her.The two are emotionally unhealthy carnage co-dependent on each other. Mutual destruction is assured but they are that dysfunctional couple that will probably stay together 10 more years nonetheless making each other miserable.The acting is mesmerizingif only because many of us recognize ourselves in the two of them. For people who appreciate excellent film with superb acting this is a MUST see. Zendaya is incredible. She is a grown woman and she acts like one in this film. John Washington is always delicious to watch but his acting is certainly closing in on his father.,10.0,1080

AndrewFNU," Raw, Loud and Extremely Accurate",Netflix announced ONE big movie for every month of 2021. In January we had The Sit an informational beautiful and peaceful movie but in February the big movie is Malcom & Marie which felt actually pretty big. Even the title itself reminds us of the tragical classic couples like Romeo & Juliet Tristan & Isolde anticipating a powerful conflict. It felt nice to see Zendaya actually playing a role which matches her acting standard and I believed her she truly deserves more serious role from now on. John David Washingtons performance is a delight to watch and his strangely chaotic stile of acting really catches you. The fact that is filmed black-white amplifies the conflict and keep it there. I couldnt get enough of the protagonists sharp lines and the knife scene is G O L D not going to say more.

nishamilk, Here's my criticism that the movie criticized,The performances truly made this movie there was not a moment that I felt Zendaya and John were lacking. The cinematography was good but it is noticeable that the physical restrictions is what formed it. They use wide shots and have the characters make up for the lack of cuts with their movement around the space. The house is supposed to be huge but I didnt feel that it was - which Sam wanted so thats a good point. The script could only be taken so far it was lame. There are definitely moments where the characters dig into each others weaknesses but I dont feel the pain I dont feel the soul-crushing words. the performances are heartbreaking but the words arent. I dont know if I should go easier on the filmmaker because of the restrictions or if I should just treated this as any movie. There was hype around this movie and it came off as dull.another thing: the choice of black and white with black characters would have truly showed the lack of effort placed on lighting dark skin but the lighting in this movie was not breathtaking. it was very sharp at some points for a plot that was showcasing emotional complexities and other times it was very monotoned and dull. I changed by brightness as some points just to see if it was me that wasnt viewing it properly,7.0,1085
julissajay-48887, If you lack depth.. you won't get it.,"This movie is phenomenal and if anyone says otherwise its because theyre lying to themselves and still think relationships are sunshines and rainbows. This movie captures what its like to be REALLY in love past the honey moon stage. Its raw; its not a dipiction of some false reality of love. It doesnt portray toxicity like some of the reviews Ive seen claims. It portrays two people who understand DEPTH whilst one (Marie) actually understand their own trauma. Toxic would look like two people projecting their mental issues past traumaS and emotional baggage all day long. However this is RAW In that the sense that two people are trying to rack through the mist and muck of their emotions with logic nonetheless. If youre one who understands their own psychology whilst understands their partners while all the while remaining grounded youll understand this movie fully. But if all you know of is booty calls ""situationships""  and trauma bonding the message goes right over your head. Poor souls.",10.0,1086
Done1517, One word: LEVINSON,"I saw a comment on Youtube that said: ""This movie is the feature length adaptation of that Marriage Story fight scene shot line an Calvin Klein ad.""This quote says nearly everything what needs to be said about the film. First of all: John David Washington and Zendaya are OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD. Both deliver a very powerful and emotional performance. At some points the cinematography is also very captivating and some of the dialogue in combination with the smooth jazz in the backround keeps you interested. Thats it. You feel throughout that Malcolm isnt talking to Marie about reviews its Sam Levinson who talks to us. I think hes very insecure with his own work and wanted to let off some steam in this one after getting a horrible review from the LA Times about one of his other films. He wraps this up in minute-long monologues of JDW talking about black filmmakers and on and on and on...I quickly lost interest.Due to (at some points) good directing and cinematography and the smooth songs still a solid 6/10.",6.0,1087
Senryu-Cherry," In a sick relationship, couple's block every red flag.","The movie is a character study of a guy who made a movie about drug abuse and a girl who is a drug abuse survivor. The movie is in greyscale which is aesthetically pleasing and can be symbolised as figuring out a grey-thin-line of comfort in this love-hate relationship. They were failing and trying to have sex throughout which can be symbolised as them trying to know the other better or just getting under each others skin to inflict more harm. Malcolm is scared of being called a ""mediocre director"". He also has limited self-awareness to the point he crucifies anyone who talks against his work or himself. Marie is extremely self-sabotaging and unable to share her feelings without passive-aggression.There are some good pointers discussed (dont quote)1. Just because Im a black man doesnt mean everything I make is political or about race.2. How indifferent/similar an artist can be to their art? (Marie says she toils with both his directional edits and him as a boyfriend for the same reasons)3. How a perspective defines ones reality? (Malcolm says you want control because you cant understand why Im with you. The reason is I love you.)4. Is an apology enough to regain trust? (Marie always feels Malcolm takes her for granted. He in fact didnt give her the credits she truly deserves but he apologised for it a million times)5. You need to appreciate yourself.(Marie has a monologue in which she reminiscents the acts she has done for Malcolm. It can look as selfishly counting ones worth but it was curing for Marie because she struggles with self-esteem)The whole movie was them projecting their insecurities and verbally abusing each other. Malcolm was worse than Marie in this case. This talking in circles is what I believe was the red flag. They are incapable of having a conversation without being hurtful. But since they truly in love (debatable) they are not addressing their incompatibility. It doesnt give you a second to breathe before bringing another session of screaming swearing and tearing the other down. And this is not how normal relationships should be there can be disagreement but not this level of abuse. Dont watch this movie if youre in a toxic relationship or trying to wind down. I was exhausted because it was incredibly overwhelming.",6.0,1088

sfworthington, Love & Art,Ill be honest this film was very difficult to watch for me but it was cathartic and I think it made me love it even more.When they started the film with the credits I knew I was in for a treat.I forgot who said this but I saw someone say that Malcolm & Marie is not a love story but instead a story about love. That seems so simple but its so so true. Who thought that perspective would make a romance like this so profound. Because this film is profound. All we have are two people two people in a relationship who love each other tear each other apart put each other back together again and then continue this cycle all in the course of one night. Ill compare it to Marriage Story in that there is no bias on either counterpart there are times you side with Malcolm and there are time where you side with Marie. Thats the key to a great romance especially when you are showing a love affair with cracks beginning to show.The fact both of these characters are artists in their own right makes emotions even stronger because as an artists you feel things in varying levels. Sometimes more strongly sometimes less so sometimes your art will tie you together and connect you like nothing else but it can just as easily break you. In this context it adds another layer to a complex relationship and thats why for me it just struck a core more so than anything Ive seen for a very very long time. Therefore I may be biased towards this film however you cant lie it captures love in a raw and unfiltered way that hurts like a knife to the heart but you would never want to be without it.Technically this film is a flourish of effective understatement with the bold use of black and white and strongly framed shots. The script is just insane and although music isnt used much and its played within the world of the film instead of underscoring the action it fits so well. Also it would be criminal of me to not mention just how amazing Zendaya and John David Washington are. Neither of them outshine each other they light each other up on screen and leave everything on the floor. Landmark performances from them both.From first glance people dont seem to be liking this film as much as I am however I do think its that kind of film take it how you want but youll experience both beauty and pain and thats a killer combo.,10.0,1090

The whole movie is basically one big fight so normal and so exaggerated at the same time with all the breaks the pauses the deep cuts a normal fight between two people in love would have. It makes you feel and remember emotions from your life even if your background is not similar to theirs you will feel them.Overall its a nice work its different than most movies out there and this is what it makes it stand out.

isaacvalderueda, In my opinion the acting of the year,Absolutely greatThe performances attracted me to say that they are the best of the yearmalcom:John David Washingtons performance is fantastic I loved the monologue in which he argues with the critics is simply incredibleMarie:I would dare to say that it is the best performance of zendaya in her career. For me it is more difficult to convey and connect to the audience through expression than screaming and crying and that is something that zendaya does in a phenomenal way and brilliantly achievedNow as for the story although not anywhere that is not worthy of saying that it is bad because as the premise of the film is that this is not a love story it is a story about love and how it changes in our lives. with that someone and as always there will be fights on the way.That verse is in my opinion something very important in the film and that without it it could not be appreciated as it deservesthe cinematography is good it is not fantastic and sometimes I think they did not know how to take advantage of the black and white format but that is my only criticismthe performance is captivating the direction falls in love a true story about how love really is,10.0,1099

williamtseng, Repetitive,Fantastic acting by John David Washington and great acting by Zendaya.But the writing is weak. I see what the movie is trying to do but it does it quite illogically. After the first argument is over and theyre happy again they start arguing about the same thing again for no apparent reason! Even though they seemed like to have solved the situation at first the argument starts up again out of no where. The arguments are emotional and seems realistic. And the movie is a great character study. But the way the arguments start are ridiculous. The movie seems like a boxing match except with arguments. One wins some rounds and the other wins some rounds. It just seems forced.I applaud the movie for being experimental. But the writing couldve been better.,7.0,1101
theshanecarr, Thank you,"Thank you for reading my review. Thank you for watching the movie. Thank you to all those who liked my review; you know who you are. Thank you to Zendaya for being so God damn good. Thank you to John David Washington for looking so fine. Thank you to Sam Levinson for Euphoria - that show blew me away and I had to see what you were cooking up next . (Mac and cheese amirite?) Thank you to mac and cheese. You held the opening together through a series of quick cuts. Thank you to beautiful modernist houses in the middle of nowhere - not only do you allow cast and crews to isolate during a global pandemic but you hold yourself apart from your surroundings so that we all must say ""Who the hell lives here?"" and ""I would not feel comfortable having sex in a lit room at night with all those windows."" Thank you to Zendayas costume designer - you had a beautiful woman and you made sure we knew it. Thank you to JDWs tux - if 2020 thought us anything it is that that man looks good in a suit. Thank you to all night arguments - we hate you at the time but we reach a better understanding because of you. At least if you havent had too much to drink which Zendaya had not because she is getting clean. (JDW had no shame knocking back a few though right guys?) Thank you to cigarettes and their power to make us look cool. Thank you to strategically placed oven lighters cause they help us get the shot without worrying about the vagaries of matchsticks. Thank you to that lady from the LA Times who must be wondering what Sam Levinson has against her. Unless she knows - then she must be thinking ""Wow. Public way to take revenge much?"" but she gonna have hella fun writing her review of this one (I really gotta go look that up.) Thank you to star power and the perception that two people arguing all night will be more interesting if its two gorgeous stars. (You are correct.) Thank you to the unfortunate choice to weight the movie towards Maries side of the argument so were never really in doubt whose side were meant to be on leaving JDW with a lot of ground to make up which he can never really do because his arguments are fairly ridiculous. Thank you to the act of shouting which JDW did a lot of and it was a bold choice but it was the wrong one. Hey live and learn. Thank you to black and white photography - hoo boy a girl can look good in black and white. Thank you to the bath tub. I would like a free standing bath tub like that. Thank you to film premieres; I have rarely been to one but I know now they are hot beds of intrigue and skullduggery. Thank you to Tana - why DID you say that thing? That was weird. Thank you to nail scissors; youre blunt and were better for it. Thank you to John Cassavetes; you cant be beat man. Thank you to covid-19; Sam and Daya woulda been making Euphoria right about now if it werent for you so I guess we have you to thank for this. Thank you to emotional honesty cause when a woman lets a man know that he has taken and taken and taken from her and he has not not repaid her in kind he needs to listen or he will find himself alone in the morning and not cause his girl is making more mac and cheese. Finally thank you to articulacy because these boozed-up late night beautiful people sure do know how to turn a phrase. Yes Sir. I may be forgetting someone but Ill catch em next time.",7.0,1102
lukaw-58038, Massively OverHated,This film delivers well on what it sets out to do its depiction of a real tested relationship with less-realistic dialogue makes it feel like a physical fight between two heavyweights who keep delivering hit after devastating hit to eachother.Its been critiqued for over-doing it in lots of aspects but everything about this film is made to be interesting to watch whether it be a noticeably long lateral tracking shot at the beginning or the bold black-and-white or the incredible dialogue. Yes real people dont talk as smoothly but isnt that the point? What if you could be a fly on the wall during a poetic argument between two beautiful people in their beautiful home?

When I read the reviews and the rating all I can say is if it was Jennifer Anniston and Brad Pitt it would have received a 99% rating across the board. If Malcolm and Marie were killing each other the ratings would go through the roof as that is how the audience likes to see Black people-killing each other but loving each other and portraying a couple going through relationship challenges and facing them out loud is probably a bit too high of a level for small minded people to get their heads around and understand the intelligence of the acting and the script.Go rate your next sci-fi movie and stay out of real people in a real world.""",10.0,1104

teriekwilliams-48053, The Point of Conversation,"Malcolm & Marie Sam Levinsons uncharacteristic foray into straightforward drama depicts an evolving argument inside of a one-act play structure. Unlike the hopeless ""cry-in-my-beer"" commiseration of the fruitless Ma Raineys Black Bottom or the circular complaint session of One Night in Miami... the central conflicts of Malcolm & Marie explore the deficiencies of the characters rather than the deficiencies of some scapegoat system.In avoiding rehashing cliched complaints the arguments of Malcolm & Marie arent just tedious arguments. They actually take the characters (and the audience) to different places all of which are real from tensions of complex relationships/people to strikingly honest reflections of phony Hollywood progressivism on race (the line: ""she thinks shes doing a public service by lifting up your mediocre a--"" describes Hollywoods diversity push among critics celebrities and Twitter today).However the structure of Malcolm & Marie requires its viewership to commit to its argumentative journey and take on its observations. Otherwise its just a tedious argument between two bitterly insecure and malformed people. Consequentially Malcolm & Marie is designed for a limited audience. Fit with exquisite cinematography Malcolm & Marie will either emerge as noisy lovers quarrel or an expectation-busting excursion into the personal political and social stresses of a couple in the modern commercial artistic sphere. For me I expected the former and was pleasantly surprised to get the latter.",7.0,1108

theredsky, Malcolm & Marie Review,This is so frustrating because this film looked very promising. Maybe I went in expecting it to be good but I was ultimately disappointed. First off John David Washington and Zendaya do an excellent job. I believed that they were portraying these characters and they really bring out their emotional moments in a powerful way. If there is anything to take away from this film its the excellent performances. However their respective characters feel very underdeveloped. Washingtons character has little to no characterization while Zendayas has some but not enough characterization. We get an interesting backstory but thats about it. The script also hampers their performances just a little bit with how basic it is. The messages the film sends are very surface level and dont leave a lot of room for interpretation. One of the messages regards white critics praising films by a black director in a political sense. While I do agree thats as deep as it gets. This idea isnt explored more and it honestly makes the film feel like a hitpiece against critics. This film did not need to be in black and white. Ive honestly tried thinking for a reason behind why the film is in black and white and I cant find one. It makes the film feel very pretentious. I did like how the film was shot though as some of the cinematography is gorgeous and I liked the song choices. If you enjoy Sam Levinsons work or these two actors then youll probably enjoy this more than I did.,5.0,1113

nicoleneolivier, Crytical eyes find deeper meanings,"I am a film student at the Univeraity of Pretoria in South Africa. A friend of mine asked me to watch Sam Levinsons film Malcolm & Marie to provide her with some depth to understand the film as she couldnt make sense of it. This review is strictly my own opinion.The use of black & white and one location places emphasis on the characters and their emotions. The isolation of the characters from the outside world makes it very intimate private and timeless. This makes the viewer feel like an intruder but also demands the viewers attention throughout the film.The modern fancy lifestyle portrayed is the ""mask"" they wear in public how they want the world to see them. The ""American dream"" however there is some disturbing emtional depth to these characters.Marie and Malcolm portrays each others inner demons.As they talk to each other the viewers get to know each character so well that it becomes uncomfortable to watch because we all have demons to fight within ourselves and this is exactly what both characters are going through. It is as though Malcolm is Maries subconcious and Marie is Malcolms subconcious because they talk about each others insecurities fears and weaknessess on such a personal level that it almost seems like something they would tell themselves one could call it the ""dark side"" of each character.The repetition of the fighting portrays the endless fight we have with ourselves as we go through life physically and psychologically.The topic of conversation is not as important in this film as the things they say to each other but it does bring about a lot of insecurities in both characters as if it triggers their emotions.During the long pauses between fights they begin to face their own truths then only true love become evident between and within both charactersThis film was made in the early stages of the COVID pandemic. A time where we were all isolated a time where I myself had conversations about how much self reflection this year had forced me to do.The characters made it through this timeless evening of inner and outer conflict facing their own truths and finding ways to love each other regardless of the circumstances. It may be argued that it is about true love but maybe we need to crytically self reflect in order to truely love ourselves in the deepest of our forms.",7.0,1116
gabrilapo, Exceptional performances by two gifted actors,Malcolm & Marie gives the opportunity to two young actors to shine.

tmpsvita," A chaotic, empty, loud, stupid noise that wants and thinks to be jazz.",This movie is just exhausting and it drags itself for 1 hour and 45 minutes in which the only likeable things are the decent cinematography and the soundtrack.1 hour and 45 minutes of forced unnatural and extremely pretentious dialogs; of poses too staged to feel authentic; of end-to-end situations that often get so exaggerated they almost get to the point to be grotesque; of mirrors put in specific places so that the director could make that totally unnecessary but so strongly aesthetic shot.A movie so arrogant not naive that constantly thinks that its sure to be smarter better and more important than it actually is.A chaotic empty loud stupid noise that wants and thinks to be jazz.,3.0,1118
jreecebozarth, A microcosm of a specific type of life,I wasnt really sure what I was getting into. That being said Malcom and Marie definitely surprised me in a good way.

They still have something of a similar soul which is a style that isnt for everyone. It has some truth and is very well shot.,6.0,1119
dacbelcher," Great movie, but not for everyone.",Malcolm and Marie is more of an artsy somewhat pretentious movie in the fact that there is not really much going on. The movie takes place over one night and only features two characters. Many would argue that there wasnt a plot but there are many films that have won awards without even having a plot. The point of this movie is to relate and understand these two characters. Personally i believe that some people are not as invested in the movie and thats why this movie is getting some bad reviews but thats ok because everyone is different. Just know before watching this movie that you really shouldnt expect any big explosions sex scenes or big plot twists. This movie is just a simple little story.,10.0,1120
luis151, Great acting and great cinematography,That is why I rate it a 6/10.Starting with the screenplay the dialogue between the two characters sounds a little off and over the top. It doesnt feel real and it just sound flat because the movie tries to come across as artsy so they dont really say anything true or meaningful. The movie starts with a fight between the couple and ends with a fight and in between these 2 fights you guessed it theres more fights. By repeating it self over and over the movie becomes a little boring.If you have seen the movie theres one scene where Malcolm starts talking about a review and it just goes on and on and it just looks like Sam Levinson has some hate bottled against some critics so this scene is kinda weird and doesnt particularly fit.All in all the acting was great and the moments where Marie isnt talking her face says it all and its there where Zandaya truly shines. John also shows his immense talent and delivers a fine performance.,6.0,1121
craigthomas90, Love is stronger than pride?,"In relationships do not be afraid apprehensive shy reluctant when it comes to saying ""Im sorry you mean so much to me."" I do believe there are subtle nuisances behind apologizing and saying I am sorry. You can be sorry but not apologetic. This film displays the variation between the two. One is lined in sensitivity empathy the other is a projection of our defense mechanisms & pride. This movie ask challenging questions about self-worth and how do you define something abstract like love? Why would you ever want someone you love to feel like bad? Why argue to be right so vehemently that you make the person you love feel weakdumb inferior conflating facts to make a bad point? I suppose we can all be a bit of #MalcolmandMarie Two people going back and forth can be suspenseful as hell! The cinematography the acting the authenticity! Dope emotional movie!

pharaohseye," Stunning, eclectic, moving and inherently insightful.",Years ago Moonlight won the Academys Best Motion Picture. To this day I struggle to understand why. Nevertheless Malcolm & Marie could sweep a few Oscar categories and Id fully understand it without effort.Those who refer to this film as being just an hour long argument are simply lost amidst the brilliance of its cinematic parlance. Malcolm & Marie is a viable study of the human condition with such genuine ferocity that it can be complicated to digest if one comes to this film with preconceived notions.I would venture a guess that there isnt a relationship of any kind lasting more than one full year that hasnt digressed at some point into something that resembles the tumult and pain of Malcolm & Marie-if even only for a fleeting moment. There is a realness and familiarity to these characters. Weve seen them in ourselves. Perhaps in our parents. Our in-laws or other relatives.This film is often uncomfortable to watch. It slaps us with pain empathy and raw emotion. And despite that reality it is hard to put down.The nearly monochromatic grayscale approach serves to focus the viewer quite myopically on the two characters that dominate the screen. The choice is obvious yet subtly self-serving. A prism devoid of color. A reticle into their life. Not relying solely on the impeccable script the adept recitation of its every emotion and monologues by Washington and Zendaya Levinson thrusts the chaotic and strained dynamic between the characters into the faces and psyches of the viewer.Both characters are fractured in ways that are irreparable inseparable and inconceivable. We feel their pain. We live their antagonism. We struggle with them to come out of the endless loop of loved-laced lunacy that permeates their reality. This is a film that makes those in the room constantly glance at one another in complete dismay and accordance.Ive talked about this film abstractly so as not to produce spoilers but rather to entice those on the fence to watch it and really open themselves to its cold disturbing embrace. Yes some professional critics are panning this film as exhaustive and laughable. Truth be told those are the very critics whose review work I find to be both.There is nothing laughable about this film. But its impact can prove exhausting. Because it strikes the heart with a massive thump that takes ones breath away.This is a genius piece of filmmaking. There is something new fresh and remarkably approachable about this movie. Its chock full of complex monologues. It embodies dizzying shifts in temperament and tone and culminates in a triumphant climax that makes you want to turn off the TV and just contemplate it out of reverence.Bravo! That was worth every second. Especially the two Oscar worthy performances.,10.0,1123
someokiedude," Free Jazz, as a Movie.",Like the free jazz of John Coltrane Miles Davis or Sun Ra Malcolm & Marie is a film that runs free and refuses to be constrained or easily defined almost beckoning you to attempt to understand it but never offering a safety net or a definitive answer for its own ponderings. It is elusive and difficult to penetrate despite its rather straightforward set up of a couple debating amongst themselves and each other on if their relationship is truly fruitful or sustainable almost like a stage play in its approach.It is a film that has been labeled as pretentious which is certainly understandable some of its dialogues often go on and on talking about topics in a way that some might find to feel wanting or desperate to sound profound or meaningful. But I never felt the condescension and self importance of The Matrix or the more egregious self-aggrandizement that Lars von Trier is capable of attempting to convince everyone how deep and meaningful he is Malcolm & Marie felt more genuine in its approach in its ponderings. It caused me to go through conflicting feelings while watching it I laughed (rather it be by design or not) I was shocked I was confused and even caught off guard emotionally. Many of the arguments and raw emotion thats touched upon in Malcolm & Marie gave me some uncomfortable flashbacks to arguments that Ive had with people in my life ones that veered into more personal matters and got extremely uncomfortable. But if I were asked what I think of the film I cant really say that I know what to make of it to be certain.What I can say for certain however is that John David Washigton and Zendaya are both excellent I must say that Ive been impressed with Zendayas change through the last couple of years as most Disney alumni of her ilk tend to either burn out (often in dramatic fashion) or fade away into obscurity but shes an exception to the rule and one that Ive been glad to see. She is mesmerizing in the role carrying a bitterness and a sardonic wit while also not afraid to let out her emotional vulnerabilities. Washingtons performance is also fantastic he speaks with the eloquence and grace as well as the intensity that is clearly from his father the great Denzel Washington but also captures a physical versatility as well which is very unlike Denzels more reticent cautious style of acting. I wonder if Malcolm is meant to have autism considering that I myself have the disorder and noticed several tendencies such as his lack of awareness for social cues an insensitivity to others feelings and often acting out in strange ways such as punching and kicking around when alone and ranting to himself though perhaps that was something that director Sam Levinson may not have even intended. Washington and Zendaya play well off of each other throughout the films runtime often challenging one another to see which one will break first to see who will outclass the other. Another thing that can be praised for certain is the films impeccable sense of design with its evocative cinematography and score mostly consisting of old classics from James Brown Duke Ellington and the aforementioned John Coltrane.The film is certainly flawed in several ways with the film basically being a series of long monologues it can feel tedious at points. It was quite disappointing at times when I caught myself becoming distracted with something else. Its not to say that a film of this type cant be done well as films like 12 Angry Men Locke and Glengarry Glen Ross have shown full well that its possible to have a film basically be a bunch of conversations and still be riveting from beginning to end even Shakespeare had the remarkable ability of using language in a way where it made mundane conversations feel powerful unique and even inspiring. Sam Levinson is not always such a man while he can craft scenes that are powerful and emotionally challenging he can just as well veer off into diatribes that make him feel wanting as if hes trying too hard to be profound and unique. While I did say that Malcolm & Marie is better with its more ponderous nature that doesnt mean that its flaws can be excused or that it can fall into the traps of other films like it.Malcolm & Marie is a film thats often oscillating between tones themes character motivation and so on. It was occasionally sad occasionally funny occasionally joyous occasionally tragic. It is a film that is often elusive leaving you more befuddled and curious than you were when you first began to watch it giving no safety nets for the audience and only giving you. All youre given is the characters as they are sometimes saying one thing while their actions suggest another. I often questioned to myself about what this film was even about and if I truly got it. If you asked me it was about two broken people whose lives are lost for two very different reasons rather it be from insecurity addiction emotional turmoil and so on. Its about two people who are both toxic to each other but are also meant for each other in their own unusual way. Its a romance one thats doomed to fail eventually and then eventually getting up for the next day is just a statement to their denial of the situation that theyre in and an indication that theyve learned nothing from their previous experiences and the cycle continues on.In the end Its one of those movies where Im unsure if I liked it hated it or just thought that it was ok. But I do know that it had me thinking and I wont be forgetting about it anytime soon.,7.0,1124
gokeadegbayibi, Thoughtful Human Drama,When I saw the conflicting reviews I had to stop reading them cause I figured out this must be one of those movies you either love or just hate - virtually no inbetweens. So I gave it a shot and well ... I think I was right. It does come across as sometimes pretending to be more than what it is so I understand the bad reviews.

Another good point to note is that the performances of both actors have enchanted me John David Washington and Zendaya are the best of the film and somehow ""save"" it and make it better than it could have been without these two actors.but unfortunately the film did not convince me completely because (although it has a good format to tell the story) I only enjoyed approximately the first 50 minutes of the movie (in which I really had a great time and did not take an eye off the TV) but the rest of the film was somewhat boring had unnecessary and irrelevant dialogues which could have been better certainly this was what made me give this rating to ""Malcolm and Marie"" and not a higher one which I wish I had done.",7.0,1131

TheVictoriousV, The message is that there isn't always a message,"Malcolm & Marie is about Malcolm and Marie. That much Im certain of. Its a statement I can safely put forth without fearing that Im making assumptions about the identity of the films creator or their intent in creating it.For a film that can so easily be summarized as ""Malcolm and Marie come home they talk and they fight"" this picture has a remarkable amount of stirring commentary on the modern film industry and the adjacent world of criticism (not as sagacious as Pixars Ratatouille but itll do). Had I been a more stereotypical critic I might have asserted that Sam Levinson is using these black characters as a convenient mouthpiece to speak out against the identity politics that suggest a directors racial/sexual/gender attributes meaningfully matter when their work is to be assessed.""Why would real blxck people (sic) ever say this about The Movement? Surely they realize that its for their sake that I the white girl from the LA Times care about black identitarianism and believe even rich movie-makers to be less privileged than me all due to race?""Maybe wed be proving his point if we were to type things like that or at least those espoused by Malcolm Elliott (John David Washington) a neophyte movie director and husband to failed actress Marie Jones (Zendaya). Maybe we ought to ask as Malcolm rantingly suggests whether the ideas themselves are valid or (ironically) if we should even fuss over what The Message might be - let us focus on the filmmaking choices which neednt be related to who Levinson is or where he came from. Then again as Marie rebuts (when breaking free from her silent numbness) there is something to be said of authenticity; basing your young marginalized characters on people who truly know the experience.This is one of the many reasons why HBOs Euphoria (also created by Levinson) was so good; Hunter Schafer for one was heavily involved in the writing of the Jules Vaughn character. Whether a piece of cinema is really meant to be about the authenticity in how the characters and topics are portrayed or the imagination in how it is handled Malcolm & Marie does well in both ways.Me I happen to be a fan of clever presentation. I love for example a movie where the actors channel a myriad of emotions throughout even the lengthiest takes (all of them beautifully lit and moodily colorless) helping the conversations (i.e. at least 85% of the runtime) remain both interesting and escalatingly tense.Levinson is scarily skilled at keeping us ensnared in scenes of pure talk. Watching the Euphoria Christmas special I felt as if I could watch an entire movie presented in this manner - think My Dinner with Andre but on the opposite end of the classiness spectrum.With Malcolm & Marie thats not too far from what I got. The problem with this I now realize is that it feels like somethings missing. Malcolm & Marie is an example of ""tell-dont-show"" done right. Its just that I might have loved it even more if it was the season finale of a TV series that yknow showed stuff.Indeed some viewers may not buy the characterizations as seen here; how the two leads move from hatred to affection to more hatred then bonding during scenes that are pretty much squarely devoted to commentary - the screenplay mostly mixes its film-industry critique with the character- and relationship development quite efficiently (Marie feels deeply hurt by some of Malcolms decisions in adapting ""her"" story to the big screen) but some of it is just ranting. Theres quite a bit of messaging in this movie about how movies dont always need to have a message.And even though I am arguably a critic albeit still a hobbyist with only the occasional guest publication under my belt I understand the sentiment. The world of criticism has become an ocean of interchangeable often snooty sometimes excessively ""academic"" essays since we lost Ebert. Its hip and cool to discuss identity politics and there may be points to make about Levinson. Me Im happy to simply inform you that the movies good but Euphoria is better.",7.0,1137
rsduffie, Just Say Thank You Already!!!!,"Never in my wildest dream did I ever think I would watch a 1 hour and 46 minute long movie with only 2 actors. But I did. And I dont regret it either.The Good:John David Washington and Zendaya had great chemistry. I believed their relationship. And the plot of the movie is unfortunately very relevant in most relationships where one spouse feels underappreciated.The scenery was beautiful to me! I think I would buy this house as a vacation home or something like that. I also like the effort to make the movie feel like ""Old Hollywood.""The Bad:Sometimes I felt that Malcom was a bit ""over the top."" He yelled so freaking much that I felt hoarse after watching this movie.The Ugly:Whew. Every man knows that you must say THANK YOU to the wifey after a huge accomplishment.Overall this was a decent movie. Great job Zendaya! Sexy as usual.If you like Love Jones Love and Basketball or Dear John but filmed in a single location and way less people in it then this movie is for you.Enjoy yourself!",7.0,1138

alindsay-al, A Good Film With Fantastic Acting,This is one of the few films that managed to be filmed during the pandemic and Netflix have now released Malcolm & Marie and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a director and his girlfriend question everything when they return from the premier of his new film.Main CharactersUsually I would split the acting into two categories but considering there are literally only two people in this film it seems logical to just put them both in this section. John David Washington plays Malcolm & Zendaya plays Marie and they are both fantastic here. They literally have to carry this film on their backs and they do it superbly well they deliver monologues that just keep going and feel like they are very real to them and the story that the characters were going through. When the nominations for the Oscars come out I would be stunned if both of these two arent nominated for two really really strong performances that should be seen and appreciated.StoryThe story is interesting it basically is set in one location and sees a night in these two peoples lives and how their relationship basically unravels and come to a head. The strength is in the performances and the way that they get you to grapple onto their characters and the turmoil more then the actual strength of the plot. There are elements that work but at times at least for me it felt like we were going in circles and were padding for time and I actually think this film could have been more effective with less if that makes sense.ScriptThe dialogue is well written and it feels very raw and emotional heck it makes you question if these two should even be together and which one of them is the worst. It allows both Washington & Zendaya to have effective moments and big acting scenes. But I will say this does feel a bit one dimensional it feels like Washington will have a monologue then Zendaya will and then rinse and repeat with very little in breaking up the structure.StyleThe film is presented in Black & White and I am not exactly sure the reason for this but it was effective to say the least it just made the film stand out and feel a bit more unique. But this film was too long for me as I mentioned above I think this film would have been way more effective if it was at least 15mins shorter and really had no filler and hit the queues that it needed.OverallOverall this is a good movie that is really well acted. I will say that this is a film that will divide opinion but I think if you want to see a film with really strong acting and intensity then Malcolm and Marie is a decent shout.,7.0,1140
mogli93, I couldn't watch the whole movie.,Not gonna lie the movie was building up to the point where malcolm starts eating mac n cheese and there was nothing interesting that happened up till then but once i saw the way he was eating i lost full and didnt watch the rest of the movie it was disgusting eating and the argument . i am not going to watch the rest of the movie.,2.0,1141

wewaj-03329, I agree with others on both sides of being good/bad,"***Spoiler alert!!First i do want to say that the movie was shot beautifully and i really liked Zandaya as she was really engaging and funny and entertaining. But JDW was just odd in this movie myself and my gf gave it 45mins but she couldnt handle it anymore. We get the story we get the acting but it was really toxic and for people not in these types of relationships it can be extremely negative and boring. I do like JDW also but he was a emotional terrorist in this movie and how can you forget to ""thank"" your spouse in a movie that was somewhat based off her?!?! But you happened to thank literally everyone else and even the dog etc lol... Either way to each their own we were expecting more since it was labelled a ""Thriller"" But Im sorry this is NOT a Thriller type movie. I would just say romance suspense thats it. I wanted to like it but i only give it a 6/10. And yes it shouldve been much shorter like others have stated.",5.0,1143
Bek204," ""This is not a love story, this is a story of love""","A director and his girlfriends relationship is tested after they return home from his movie premiere and await critics responses. (Via IMDB)First the film isnt dull its just full of dialogues and conversations which makes it seem like its a boring/dull film. But the dialogues were so genuine/deep (sometimes) and of course Zendaya and John David Washington made them 10 times better. I think without them the film wouldve been DEAD. Now John David Washingtons performance was good. But wouldnt say that its his best one. His performance in ""Tenet"" (2020) and in ""Blackkklansman"" (2018) was better. In some scenes I felt like he was just trying so hard to look great and to show everyone that he can fit any role. But Zendayas performance was the best which could be because of her characters past that had so many things in it. But she still killed that performance.I think the reason that makes the film boring/slow/weak is that its story is very simple and its set in one location (the couples house) and one night. There are many films that are set in one location and were able to entertain the audience but this films story is ""TOO SIMPLE"" and there is nothing special about it or something that would make you connect to this couple or makes the audience curious/excited to know what will happen next. NOTHING NEW AT ALL.The dialogues are the films main thing. They were switching/jumping between conversations/topics about the history of cinema/filmmaking how critics see films some important political topics and each characters past. And In my opinion the only ones that I was interested in were the most interesting were the ones about the characters past felt like these other topics were too much and were just added there to fill the films runtime. They were so boring to listen to.The directing was great. Really loved the black & white in this film and its tone. There are also some visually stunning scenes that I enjoyed looking at. The set design (which is just the couples house) is very beautiful and I really love it.The songs that were used throughout the film were all beautiful and reflecting the couples story perfectly. But sometimes they were louder than the speech which made it hard to listen to what they were saying.To sum up the film is a bit boring especially that its full of dialogues that were sometimes good and sometimes not necessary at all. But it has some really great acting performances.My rating is 6.5/10",6.0,1144
cbentrott, Something real and different!,Things I liked: the intelligent dialogue and passionate monologues by both actors Zendayas emotions in the bathtub scene and how there were a lot of relatable topics covered in the film.Things I didnt like: the film became a commentary on critic reviews and lost the emotion of the moment between the two actors it had so much potential to be a moving film but it got lost in the commentary and the acting sometimes was inconsistent.,7.0,1145
alex-frey-pattaya," Brilliant, Authentic and Thorough",Before people watch this movie they must know what to expect when you read Zendaya and John David Washington assuming the leading roles one should know they are the only actors in the movie. Sam Levinson showed with Euphoria already that he is bold and unafraid to be authentic.Levinson spoke with Zendaya daily about Euphoria during the pandemic they were bored to be shut down and decided to make a movie Covid-Friendly at Zendayas house. Apparently he already wrote half of the script for Washington before he even asked him if he was on board.The result is stunning amazing and brilliant and absolutely thorough and beyond. This film is definitely not for everyone it will make people feel uncomfortable it will bore some people and it will excite those willing to sink in.Levinson transformed a former Disney Teen into a serious actress with Euphoria she is extremely good in this show but never gets to showcase her range in Malcolm and Marie he lets her off the leash worked parts of her Euphoria character in created even an easter egg scene and whoever is still on board after 45 minutes will be impressed with her Oscar Performance. The same goes for Washington a brilliant and unafraid delivery from the first to the last scene.The Dialogues are familiar and surprising and shockingly thorough we all have been in their shoes more often as we want to and exactly that made this movie so interesting. With attention to the detail you will love it.,10.0,1146

It reminded me of another film I saw years ago and it also made me want to claw my eyes out and want the time I spent back.

Either way I decided to give it a chance since I am a big fan of both actors and I am so glad that I did! The relatable characters and the pure emotion that they put into their performances removed the assumption of pretentiousness. The script is truly captivating and tells an honest story. There is a perfect mix of humor anger and reflection written into the script. Normally I get bored of movies that take place in one location but oh my god I could not take my eyes of this film. The performances were so raw and captivated how difficult relationships can be under the right stressors. I saw pieces of myself in Marie and I think the character depicted the feelings of insecurity and lack of self love that one can experience throughout a relationship. Highly recommend !!!,10.0,1153

slp-65008, Malcolm and Marie,"This movie isnt going to be for everyone. But that doesnt mean its not an excellent movie.Our two stars return home from a premiere of Malcolms where an argument ensues after Malcolm forgets to thank Marie during his speech. Like a scab you cant stop picking each character cant help but go back to push the line of hurting their partner one more time.The film delivers heavy hitting psychological jabs simply through the dialogue. It makes us question what it means to critique others intentions it makes us question what our race plays in opinions and analysis and it subjects us to many other complex issues solely through well performed dialogue with stunning noir cinematography.For those that have seen Euphoria youll have witnessed the writing ability of Levinson before. Levinson has shown with Malcolm and Marie that his talent goes even further and that hes got a pythonic grip on reality with a superb talent for nudging audiences to reevaluate theirs.Both leads gave excellent performances. The only gripe I have with the casting unfortunately would be that although Zendaya gave an incredible performance she looks too young to be playing Marie. Marie is meant to have been a junkie at the age of 20 but is now ""recovered"" Zendaya looks slightly too young and fresh faced as she only looks 20-22 on screen because the dialogue constantly mentions the age of her drug induced years it was just too hard to ignore - curse you beautiful skin! Regardless this shouldnt take away from her performance and it is another weapon to add to her artillery of great work over the past few years.",8.0,1155
kjproulx, Very Repetitive with Stellar Performances,When it comes to one-location films Im usually cautiously optimistic every time. When this type of film is done right it can really shine and be memorable for the filmmaking techniques involved throughout. The reason Im usually cautious is due to the fact that there have been multiple films that dont do enough to hold your interest leaving you bored with the scenery over and over again. Now streaming on Netflix Malcolm & Marie is one of the latest films to take place entirely at one location. While its very far from perfect heres why I at least admired it so much.After the premiere of his first feature film Malcolm returns to his rental home with his girlfriend Marie. Feeling high and mighty after the stellar response his cockiness gets the better of him. This in turn releases an endless number of thoughts about each other. Essentially this film is 106 minutes of arguing. That may not seem appealing but it all comes down to whether or not you believe these characters and I absolutely did.John David Washington has proven time and time again that hes a force on camera. Whether youre talking about BlacKkKlansman or smaller movies like Monsters and Men or The Old Man and the Gun Ive just loved his commitment to each role. On top of his great performance once again here I think his co-star Zendaya actually stole the show from him on multiple occasions. Other appearing in Spider-Man films and being very solid in The Greatest Showman I hadnt watched any of her earlier television roles as a child actress. It wasnt until her starring role in the HBO series Euphoria that I then told myself I need to see every future project that includes a performance by her. She has really come a long way as an actress and her performance in Malcolm & Marie felt incredibly raw and I loved every second of it.Where I feel this film falls apart is actually in the greatness of these performances and the stellar filmmaking overall. From the unique cinematography by Marcell Rev to the great direction by Sam Levinson (both of whom worked on Euphoria with Zendaya) Malcolm & Marie is simply too long of a film for the material being presented. It takes place over one night and follows a couple arguing in different rooms. Everything about the movie itself is elegant but by the time it reached the second act I started getting hints of Déjà Vu. I was sucked in by the camerawork and performances in the first act I even liked where the movie ended but certain conversations or things the characters were doing just started to feel incredibly repetitive. It felt like different versions of the same scene were happening over and over again.Overall Malcolm and Marie is a massive showcase for how talented of a director Sam Levinson has the potential of being and also that John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible performers. I feel disappointed in retrospect because there was so much potential on the table. Its not that the film fell apart its that after a while there wasnt anywhere new to take this film on an intellectual level. Things are said later on in the film as a revelation which I felt was already implied without saying a word earlier on. This movie was very confused with the notion of show-dont-tell. In the end for film lovers like myself its absolutely worth a watch but I really dont believe it was as good as it couldve been.,6.0,1156

DanielNButler, Every filmmaker could learn a lot about themselves in Malcom & Marie,I found this film interesting because of how it was made: shot during a pandemic with very limited resources. As a filmmaker Ive worked with limited resources and sometimes the script has to be so simple that the audience cannot tell we worked with what we could under the circumstances. Glad to give Hollywood a glance at the little guys for a change.It was a well casted duo who carried a character driven script in one location much like a two person play. The monologues were brilliant and endless. Zendaya steals the show early but JDW catches up in the second half. With a dash of brief comedy this toxic relationship takes these two to some dark areas and doesnt hold back. An excellent product made under strict circumstances.,9.0,1158

Icecoldheart," Like a beautiful play, captured on 35mm film.","If you go into this film thinking its an adapted theatre piece you are going to really appreciate it. Being aware that it was set during a few hours of this couples night that it was an intimate look into their lives it was truely special. The blocking of each scene is so meticulously mapped out despite it looking so natural. The way there able to frame each character like one character walking into frame by a mirror and the other leaning by a door frame purely beautiful composition. And yet upon reading about the film I see that some of the scenes had improvised blocking with a hand hold camera capturing each moment. In fact the first two days of footage for the opening scene was cut out in favour of a more relaxed improvised version which spurred Zendaya to turn to John David Washington and say This is how he works"". This film comes from Sam Levinson the creator and main director on the HBO hit Euphoria and you can really see that the man has a way to beautifully capture a performance. He has a way to make each frame look so alluring and eye catching. You could tell Levinson has a short hand with his cinematographer Marcell Rév and the rest of the crew (from Euphoria) to pull off such a seamless film during a pandemic. Each shot is filmed and edited so harmoniously with not a single shot or scene out of place. The pacing and dialogue is on point. And boy oh boy the driving vehicle of the film is of course the two powerhouse performances by Zendaya and John David Washington. They both have palpable chemistry that makes your heart skip a beat when each character says something cruel about one another. They both portray very complex and troubled characters. Ive loved each of these actors for a while now and I have to say foreseeably they smashed this project out of the park. I had moments where I despised Malcom for what he said to Marie and moments that I relished of his (like his entrance/ dance scene). Zendayas Marie at points seems unstable and yet the most rational in a scene. This film whilst fundamentally about a complex relationship is in my opinion more geared toward people that either love cinema or perhaps are an artist themselves. It is definitely a film that will please actors and filmmakers as they can appreciate both the way it was created and the way it was beautifully performed. But calling this film an art house piece is predictable. I mean come on its filmed on 35mm black and white film! - Follow Ofcourse Thats Cinema on Instagram Vero and YouTube for more!",8.0,1161
victory-748-144163, Very real. More artistic.,It gives a more artistic vibe more heavy and stressful. Not easy going. Not very enjoyable.But I think these types of thought provoking films are usually like that. Ive had many fights going through the entire night both grown adults crying imagining the future of us being apart both having foul things to say to each other.Not being new to the situation depicted I think it gives me much to think about. Theres just so much to the relationship dynamic that shows when two are fighting. I personally think this is worth watching but know what youre getting into and make your own choice whether or not to watch this. Your mindset around the show will shape how you percieve it.,8.0,1162
vatsimmons," Pretentious, gorgeous, and surprisingly captivating","First I want to give props to everyone involved in the film. Two people literally doing nothing but arguing is a tough sell (especially at 1hr 45 min) but I watched it through and found myself engaged and entertained through a good chunk of it. The same reasons I enjoyed this movie will be the same others dislike it:1. Its pretentiousThis is a very wordy film. If you dont have an extensive vocabulary you will feel insulted. While I admit that the verbiage is overdone more than once Levinsons screenplay lets you know that Malcolm & Marie is for art house lovers aka ""real movies"". And I appreciate that.M&M is also shot in Black & White (a beautiful choice but still very pretentious). The cinematography is beautiful.2. The actingJohn David Washington & Zendaya both killed it based on what they were given (see above point about the screenplay). I expect an Oscar nomination for Zendaya and at least a Golden Globe nod for Washington depends on how crowded the field is.3. Sam Levinsons styleAs a fan of Euphoria I was happy to see Zendaya and Labrinth coming into the fold with Sam. As expected the movie is sleek with a great soundtrack and editing.Even with all those positives this movie isnt about much so Ill go with a 7. Expect some Oscar nods though.",7.0,1163

First of all you need to be in the mood to be capable of watch it and be a good experience.In the begging of the movie i was wondering why this couple have no chemistry but quick realized thats kinda of the point. Is a deep hurt couple they are so full of each other and that need to be reflected someway.Is not my favorite movie but i think is a good one is true and real.I can understand why so many people didnt liked it the script is heavy and and the theme is not easy to watch. You are literally watching a couple fight. They are not likable they are not perfect they are just two human beings.About the performance of the two verry talented actors i enjoyed they dont make you feel good but thats the point because the characters are not well they are not good people or bad they are what they are and the actors put there so well on the screen. They are not trying to you like them they are fighting to each other simply as that.I enjoyed the photography and the black and white filter it feels very melancholy.In general is a good movie but remember you need to be in the mood!,7.0,1164
Valken-Industries, Be careful what you grab from the past...,"This is a movie with amazing acting beautifully shot and music that stands out - yet doesnt distract. Those are some of the items that helped make this great. It is based on two people and their night together digging up the past. I feel it is trying to teach us a lesson. One that I will dive into below...Remember Lots wife...Third shortest verse in the bible.""Cool and how does that apply?""Let me explainLots wife looked back on the old life they were living. The question is how did she look back? Did she look back longingly in disgust in amazement in regret with nostalgia in anticipation that nothing will be better moving forward was she excited for the next chapter was she angry was she sad was she happy? Well she was turned to a pillar of salt so we will never know.As for this movie it is an example/warning of when we look back and how we use it. Similar to the scripture I feel that this movie is advising us to be careful when looking back. If we dig up the past lets do it so that we can be better lets not do it so we can fling around mud and make everyone else feel gross and dirty.How do Malcom and Marie move on from such a tumultuous night? Hopefully side by side...Does bringing up the past have consciousness? Yes so be careful what you dig up because some things are better left unsaid. At the same time dont bury things in your past without acknowledging them first. Just be careful with how that takes place. Use your words to build up not tear down. If you have to tear it down realize that you are damaging it in the process and do so with such care and consideration that you dont leave another memory buried in your past in hopes that it never gets unearthed...Malcom and Marie uncovered items from the past day and months/years that were hurtful yet necessary to get them on the same page. Be careful with what you bury and what what you dig up.Okay enough preaching ;) back to my 8... Well I am sad that it ended. How do they move on? There wont be a sequel so dont leave me hanging. If we are to watch these two dig up the past and use it like that what are the repercussions? Is that good is it bad? Yes they said sorry yes they said thank you. But I wanted more clarification yet - at the sametime an 8 out of 10 is pretty high. Because this shouldnt be a perfect showcase of how to handle the past - but more a more glimpse of what it looks like when doing it. Its up to us to decide how or if we want to replicate this in our lives and more importantly with whom.",8.0,1165
zkonedog," ""Thank You""","Sometimes the best artistic endeavors come from odd or unplanned circumstances. Spielbergs shark malfunctions in Jaws? It ultimately sets the standard for unseen creepiness. Harrison Ford sick with a cold on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark? Produces one of the most hilarious/endearing scenes of the entire film. In that same vein ""Malcolm & Marie"" was created in the midst of a pandemic thus necessitating only two leads a stripped-down crew/location and a rushed process. No time to make everything perfect or obsess over the small details. What results through this uncharacteristic process is an equally uncharacteristic cinematic experience.For a very basic overview ""Malcolm and Marie"" tells the story of the titular lead characters coming home from Malcolms (John David Washington) film premiere. While hes bouncing off the walls with energy wife Marie (Zendaya) seems a bit perturbed. Viewers quickly come to realize that Malcolm forgot to thank Marie in a speech and that rift sets off an argument that continues deep into the night.On the surface it might be easy to see this flick as an angry one or a pretentious one or even an overly simple one. But it is anything but those things. Instead it portrays the very human way that individuals communicate (or dont communicate) with each other and how that leads to repressed emotions and a buildup of emotional scar tissue. ""Malcolm & Marie"" rips through such old wounds to be an absolute treatise on how people argue or express emotions through conversation. Sure not all may be able to put themselves in the exact shoes of a film producer and his insanely glamorous wife but I can all but guarantee everyone has gone through a similar scenario with a spouse significant other parent sibling friend etc. In other words there is nary a person alive who wont be able to relate to what is transpiring between the two leads.On an even deeper level director/writer Sam Levinson turns the tables on the characters so many times that by the end viewers are as stripped to the bone as the arguing couple. For example at equal points one will be ""in the corner"" or either Malcolm or Marie but then quickly realize the situation is much more complicated. Fortunately the end goal here isnt to crown an ""argument winner"". Instead it is to show what the process looks like and what each party wants at the end of the long night.To accomplish this terrific acting is needed--and gotten in spades. Washington is equal parts cool and likable yet also extremely insecure and patronizing. He also delivers a few epic monologues here that remind me of his famous thespian father (Denzel). Zendaya matches him ""blow for blow"" if you will slowly transitioning from ""dont want to do this right now"" partner to an emotional wreck as many old wounds/suspicions come home to roost. She also has a signature scene that will have you picking your jaw up off the floor.Sadly all anyone seems to be talking about regarding ""Malcolm & Marie"" is the scene in which Malcolm (echoing a real-life event from Levinsons past) lambasts a critic for her review of his film. A bit of a controversial scene but even then it portrays many truths wrapped up in a number of insecurities and passions. Thats what one always gets with this movie--no hard and fast answers but rather an emotional wallop that will leave you sorting through it for days after viewing.I truly hope that over time people begin to see ""Malcolm and Marie"" for what it really is: an utter tour de force on the nature of arguments relationships and how difficult it can be to honestly express ones feelings to another. To my mind there is much award-worthy material within its runtime.",10.0,1166

gaiacherici, 50/50,"Personally I think that this movie could have been better. During all the time I had the feeling that the producers wanted it to be ""the perfect Hollywood movie"" without succeeding maybe if they didnt focus on that aspect it could have gained more positive reviews. After all the acting was very good the actors both gave all themselves and you can tell it by the length of their speeches and the emotions they show but it was extremely repetitive and slow.At the beginning it was very nice but it should have ended there it could have made much more sense.I gotta say that it gave me quarantine vibes maybe they did it on purpose.",5.0,1173

justjuliaa34," Pretentious, Repetitive, Self-Important",Was looking forward to this movie because I am typically a fan of dialogue-heavy slice of life films and I was excited to see Zendaya and John David Washington.

It seemed like Sam Levinson wanted to flex his knowledge of film and make pretentious declarations about art. Disappointed.,3.0,1175

megbee, Heartbreaking and real,"Im watching this movie thinking to myself ""if a man ever spoke to me that way I wouldnt tolerate it. I would simply leave."" But truth is men have talked to me this way. Ive been in countless relationships like this where I ride the roller coaster because the highs outweigh the lows. But do they really? And in the back of my head Im thinking Ill leave next time if it gets worse. This film clearly wasnt very liked by critics and I can understand why in some cases. They claim the movie is shallow too pretentious to be genuine but ultimately it perfectly captures what its like to be in an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship. Where the carrousel never stops and you dont even really know whats keeping you from jumping off. Its well written a little too well written yes but it tells a story that many people can relate to.",7.0,1177

masonfisk, DON'T FORGET TO SAY THE RIGHT THING...!,A recent Netflix release starring John David Washington & Zendaya. Taking place in a rented home during the night we have our leads Washington a filmmaker & Zendaya his on the mend from drugs muse celebrating the reception his latest film has gotten. What starts out as a seemingly joyous celebration soon devolves into a night of accusations recriminations & regret as Zendaya feels at first she wasnt thanked properly during his speech but then as the verbal scab pulling intensifies she reveals she wanted the coveted role (she is an aspiring actress) which puts Washington on the hot seat. Filmed in gorgeous black & white writer/director Sam Levinson (Zendaya is front & center on his HBO adaptation series Euphoria) wisely lets the actors eat up the volleys as the words start to fly & sometimes catch metaphorical blood. The two leads are great here showing theyre not just one trick ponies but actors of substance willing to go places others wont.,7.0,1181

eclec-28760," Good, but annoying",This is good and annoying. The acting is great. Its impressive to see both of the actors bounce from intense to watching how they manage to use just the right words to cut each other. These are two highly intelligent people who know how to push each others buttons. And while you always want to pick a side part of the triumph of this movie is that its hard for the viewer to do. One of the partners near the end rather triumphs in making their point but still you get the right and wrong from both of them. Kind of like any relationship. Its real; although Im not sure that most of us fight with quite the level of intellectualism of these two but an hour and a half of bickering cant help but to be annoying.,6.0,1183
iatsuko, Enjoyable.,I think it was enjoyable because of the ups and downs but sometimes you dont understand the madness and the screenplay writing isnt that good to be honest but sometimes its good and the lingering on things is too much in this movie (NO SPOILERS) one of them spent more than 5 min on a single subject and it was not worth it!.

cathode-94655, Team Marie,I rated this an 8 because I spent the day after watching it thinking about it!The arguing was exhausting so I guess drew me in although I had to turn the volume right down. However they were a captivating pair of talkaholics (seemingly on aderol). Realistically considering the boundaries crossed it was all a little over civilized there wasnt even any interrupting. Also inconclusive because Malcom just wanted to win and Im not sure any of their problems were solved. Slightly disappointed on that front and not expecting a sequel which I would definitely watch.,8.0,1185
bigakuacedia, More suited towards couples.,8/3/2021Recommended to me by Senpai I was told it was going to be a slow film that picks up towards the middle. The film already had my attention when the couples fight started as I drew relation to me and Senpais arguments. I was curious to see what unfolded and how they resolved their disagreements.I found Maries dialogue to be at times too complicated with the use of complex words which threw me off sometimes. As for Malcolm I was disgusted with his behaviour at first but it has become neutral at the end of the film. His rant towards the film critic from LA Times was awfully targeted and contributed little of the plot of the film.Senpai thought...,7.0,1186
r96sk," Not sold on a lot of what this offers, but the acting from Zendaya and John David Washington is absolutely phenomenal",Not sold on a lot of what this offers but the acting from Zendaya and John David Washington is absolutely phenomenal - flawless in fact.The aforementioned duo are truly outstanding I loved their performances from start-to-finish; whether it the more serious bits or the more amusing parts. Great delivery best acting Ive seen in a film in a while - no word of a lie.As noted at the top Im admittedly not fully sure about the rest of the film. Im definitely not saying its bad disappointing or anything but I am unsure about it. Honestly though the two leads take away any negatives I may have from the productions other departments. They elevate it for sure.Id fully recommend checking out Malcolm & Marie - if only for Zendaya and Washington.,9.0,1187
loladaniels-35712, enjoyable just a bit repetitive,I did genuinely enjoy this film. i can understand why some might not enjoy it as it can get repetitive and unrealistic at some points (of my knowledge) for example the fact that it all happens over just one night. i guess in some cases stuff like that does happen just over one night but it felt a little forced in this film.zendaya and johns acting is very good and i did enjoy their dynamic. One part of the movie i found long and quite annoying was Malcolms rant scene about the ladies review. it felt like it was never going to stop and it felt forced.a scene that really stuck out to me was Zendayas thank you speech at the end of the movie. it was so nice and refreshing to watch and listen to after all the arguments that had happened prior. she did an amazing job and it felt very realistic and you could tell that Marie was hurting deeply.but i must say this film was very visually pleasing and beautiful. sam levinson did an amazing job cinematically and the shots throughout the film were just spectacular. i found myself complementing every scene. i liked the black and white filter it made the movie seem calm even though the situations that were happening were very chaotic at some points.overall i did enjoy this film. it was a beautiful movie with very good actors in it who did an amazing job.,7.0,1188

libbylbroadfoot," One of the most incredible films I've ever seen, with consistently stunning cinematography",This film is beautifully written the cinematography was truly stunning very single shot was like a painting. Ive read through many of the reviews on here and there is a clear divide between people who recognise this incredible film as a work of art and people who think its too boring or too long or too wordy. I see why this film may not be for everyone if you prefer action or fast past films but its unfortunate they think it makes it a bad movie. The conversations are powerful the true emotions in a arguement are presented so accurately and artful I felt the pain the characters were feeling. This is a brilliant example of the extraordinary work a collection of talented people can produce. Labrinths music is used so elegantly as a form of communication the cinematographers use of depth and framing in doorways mirrors windows to create visual barriers between the characters is exceptional I was constantly in awe of this. Both Zendaya and Johns acting was so powerful and moving even in scenes of them silent barely doing anything I simply couldnt take my eyes off the screen. People are complain because this isnt a conventional film but millions of underrated art is dismissed because people are too lazy to interpt it. This is a film that wants to make you feel something and Ive never been so moved by a film. Thank you for making this with the challenges of small crew and the pandemic youve created one of the greatest films a true film with true emotion.,10.0,1190
busrakarasu," Hauntingly beautiful: Amazing music, cinematography, story and acting","Reviews do not do justice to this movie with two black protagonists. Your average white American male critique wasnt ready to hear about the ""white critique"" afterall.There is so much to write about just a few points:Relatable characters and the story line: It is bouleversant overwhelming in a good way. In the midst of so many cheap hollywood comedies and excessively violent dramas this is what you expect from a movie. It is relatable yet doesnt try to be a crowd-pleaser; it leaves you thinking without trying hard to be a ""festival movie"" either. Drug story was not necessary the line is powerful on its own.Compatibility between actors: as someone who hasnt watched neither zendaya nor washington in any of their film before I find them both perfect for their couple roles here. Not only the looks but the contrast in their voices and how they complement each other.Novelty: the choice of the location. the fact that it is shot during pandemic only in about 2-3 weeks which is genius and protagonists also actively take part in the production.",10.0,1191

Its an hit!We can see a very good flow between the music and angles chosen to this movie.The choice to present the film in all black and white represent the seriousness of the topic of the movie.The connection between this two is very good they transport us to the root of their relationship and their story. What it seems to begin with small problem turns out to be a roller coster of emotions that both wanted to scream at each other.I find it a little bit repetitive but when the fights rekindles they always have good arguments but the tiredness stops once you realise the love for each other throughout the movie and especially her love in the end.Its a movie that clearly transmits the relationship and the stories of the protagonists I think those ideas are very clear and congratulations to the actors and writers.Finally its a very fluid movie the idea and message could be transmitted in less time but overall it0s a great effort and movie.Thank you and nice films!,8.0,1196
clarissaquaranta, PURE CINEMA,Making cinema does not necessarily meas telling absurd stories or heroic deeds. Making movies means to tell something.Telling it does not punch with a long story. Just tell it.Telling it with colors (and non-colors). With expressions. With bodies. WITH FRAMES AND MACHINE MOVEMENTS. This movie is pure cinema.,8.0,1197
harrylosborne, Relationships under the lens,From the moment Malcom and Marie walk through their door there is a palpable sense of something awry. An intangible wall separates the two of them conveyed through speech and movement.This is what makes this film special: whilst it relies on a heightened sense of what relationship arguments are based on (and could definitely have been shorter) there are fundamentals beneath that anyone who has ever cared for somebody else will have felt.Their nagging desire to continue any argument in the hope of stumbling to a resolution is so human it pains you to watch it. They make the same mistakes any other person would. Whilst their quarrels continue you see their antagonism grow as you begin to consider other influencing factors.The monochrome palette simplifies the set and enhances the lighting all shot beautifully through clever camera placement and sharp focus. This benefits Zendaya and John David Washington both actors who use their faces to maximum effect in conversation. I think what I most enjoyed was that it ultimately felt real.Arguments are hard to write; they require impulse a selfish mind to shout what it feels and this is what sets Malcolm and Marie out - the fact that I actually believed them. I think some people might have not enjoyed this film because ultimately they probably saw some similarities with themselves.,7.0,1198
Gn_opinionate, Captures the inexplicable,Every element of the movie made me feel essentially frustrated and I didint understand why. However translating it makes me believe that in relationships there are inexplicable feelings and in my reading this is what the movie is about. It is hard to understand ourselves let alone another person. There are several stories of the huge fights in relationships but who talks about the feelings? The deep feelings that connect and separate the loving partners at the same time. If you think of an everyday fight between partners you realize that it is nothing like in the movie we wish it would be. In life people dont try to understand one another... they shout break staff and interrupt each other. In the movie in spite of the tension and contradiction the lovers listen reflect and react to the others speech. Most of all I adored the camera angles... the way they presented the distance between the two hears by putting the wall of the house between them for example. The visual elements speak for themselves and help us understand the wars the characters fight in their souls. Yes the war should be proclaimed against ourselves because deep down we create it not the other person. The movie consists of a mixture of contrasts: silence long dialogues; hate love; hurting being hurt; woman man etc. It has a unique atmosphere lovely scenes cuts camera angles. It is pure art. The acting is incredible they need to present inner pain built up frustration and at times give irrationally long monologues. I liked the (often negative) feelings and thoughts that emerged in me during the movie they are worth reflection. After one week I still catch myself thinking of it so all in all I find it impactful.,8.0,1199

sydenham-00155, Enjoyed it,A movie about communication or lack there of it. I really enjoyed the dialogue in this movie however I thought it was unrealistic. The vocabulary thats used while the actors are full blown arguing isnt realistic. I think this film is a good depiction of the dynamics of modern day relationships and the on screen chemistry between the actors is one of the best Ive seen in recent times. They go from heated arguments to just about to make love really smoothly and naturally. The film is quite repetitive and is seemingly like mini loops of the same thing but with different arguments.They both make really compelling arguments for what they are upset with each other but ultimately its clear that they both need each other in different ways and for different things and they both have a need to be validated.,7.0,1201

It forces you to look at each characters perspective. Their raw emotions. The relationship is real. Not some feel good fake rom com. You experience from Malcom and Marie every sting and barb they throw soul shattering introspection regretful words thrown out in anger defeat their humiliations insecurities and their love. Doing this film in black and white was brilliant. The void of color doesnt distract you from their narrative. It makes you focus on it. I cannot say enough about it. This was my revolutionary film.

salexandria_f, Amazing acting,"I think that this movie has gotten reviews from many people who werent reviewing the full movie. The two actors in this movie were amazing.

aldo-64339, Hope in Cinema Restored.,Films like this are very hard to get right mainly because they play out more like theatre than a movie. Just two people confined by their words. However I think the director manages to keep us the audience engaged with a great script fine acting and striking black and white cinematography.This film explores the Art vs Soul vs Human interaction that many artists struggle with. Literally consumed by their art to the point of destruction.Malcolm is a man devoid of any empathy unless it revolves around the limitations of his art whilst Marie is his sponge an entity for him to feed on. Underneath their exterior are two people madly in love struggling to recognise one anothers qualities because theyre consumed by finding meaning and/or recognition in their art.Malcolm and Marie is a complex movie. It challenges you to listen. It wants you to feel its rhythm. It reminded me of once being a young person who took art way too seriously. It also made me want to eat mac and cheese at 2am!Overall refreshing cinema that has restored my faith in filmmaking.,8.0,1207
mohammedsalehali99, Pretty Good,Malcolm & Marie is not a movie for everyone. I personally love this kind of drama and I really enjoy it however some people may find it boring and dull.

joostkale, Simplistic but keeps you interested,A movie doesnt have to be complicated or have a lot of characters. This movie starts with two characters who we dont know. Two hours later we end with the same characters but we know them better than their parents. In these two hours we get two of the best performances of the year. Zendaya and John David Washington are so incredible that I dont know if this movie would have worked if they wouldnt have been cast. This entire movie is about their relationship. That means that if you dont care about them as a couple the movie just becomes a forgettable overdramatic romance. But is isnt. From the moment these two arrived I was invested in the story and that didnt go away until the credits rolled. At the end it becomes a bit repetitive and long but its already amazing that you can amuse me with two hours of pure fights and monologues. Its not going to be for everybody but it sure as hell was something I enjoyed.,8.0,1214

latasha-31325, A solid film!,"When I first put the film on I had no idea what to expect. I wasnt in the loop and I had never heard of the film. I watched it on a whim because I know the actors involved usually give good performances and I thought we shall see where this goes. The accuracy to which this film depicts domestic back and forth is like nothing else Ive seen recently. The reviews saying this is dull are coming from those either single or not use to seeing drama without realty show pauses in between. This is life people its messy and its boring and if your black and happen to frequent mostly white spaces it might involve using the term ""white lady"" on more than a few occasions. Also the camp of entertainment critics providing negative reviews as a way to close ranks because he apparently called out one of your own. Get over your selves because while your head was so far up some place it doesnt belong you missed the Brilliant way this film depicts how a couple shapes one another how with each argument they were growing becoming something more. This want just a couple going after each other. This was two people breaking each other down to the studs and rebuilding something new in its place. A higher respect for women. A new enthusiasm for life. A better work ethic. Better drive. Stronger determination. Gratitude. Appreciation and the unity at the end was not lost on me either. This was a solid film! Watch it.",8.0,1217
mmcneil007, Oscar worthy performances,"Definitely a tour the force. The last movie I saw like this and I was reminded of it was Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Both Zendaya and Washington poured out the repressed emotions of their relationship with realism and sincerity. The writing was crisp and appropriately responsive to each characters verbal assault on the other.I saw a review that the movie was ""pretentious."" Not to my eye. There were no pretensions and carrying the verbal volleys in the confines of the house and in black and white assured there were no distractions from the focus on the dialogue.I will watch it again since a couple of the surprises will be behind me and I will digest the dialogue further.",9.0,1218
Bleke01, Decent and worthwhile but lacking,Although there is only two people in one house I was kinda expecting it to be more visually told. It was really nothing interesting about the visuals extending the core narrative of the movie. It kinda seems like the story and the visuals was thought as two separate entities. Which kinda suffers the film more than it helps it.I think the story revolves around a past that we really cant access to. And there really isnt that much at stake for the relationship to survive or not. It kinda feels like an exercise that is often common in film school. Or trying to critique established normative rules within films without actually making it work.The anger and dysfunction seem to come out of nowhere and persist through the entire movie. There is a lack of a build up and we have no understanding of what is actually the character motives and desires. And why they do as they do. I also would think that a story taking place in a presence would have more effort in the presence. A more interesting story would perhaps be that they were waiting for a car taking them to a premiere. Then it would also make sense to have a conflict around things that have happened and what is going to happen next. Then it would actually be suspenseful.It kinda seems like the story has already happened and we are watching the review and not the movie.,7.0,1219

The acting. The fight sequences. Thats it a B/W film.And let me tell you that zendaya and david .WA were the best for these tao roles.Overall i give the movie a six.

dejohnam-98420, Could have been great,"While having never read the book the premise of the movie was intriguing. To me it seemed like the perfect wish fulfillment a movie about girls fighting back and making waves. Ultimately I was left feeling a tad empty and like many of the ""intersectional"" moments in the film were unearned.Without spoiling the film I want to say that intersectionality is more than simply including women with various identities. A transgender character is given one line about dead naming but then isnt given any sort of character arc. Two characters are revealed to be LGBTQ+ in a single kissing scene but we dont see them really speak to each other the rest of the movie? My cynical side believes this was done so the movie could be shown in more countries by editing out these moments. Much space is given to the main character and her journey with feminism boys and her family which I think was a mistake. There were really fascinating characters that could have built a fantastic intersectional ensemble cast. Give this cast a plot that investigates the nuanced experienced journeys of feminine people! Instead were given throw away lines about gender disability ethnicity race that feel like a screenwriter checking off boxes. Only the character with a mobility disability is ever actually funny with her quips at able-bodied extras.Despite my qualms with the story we were given this is a well directed movie with great performances. Only in a few scenes did the absurdity of the plot get in the way of believability (the principal knowing dismisses a few things that at most high schools would have resulted in at least an investigation). I wont watch again but Im glad this movie exists for todays high schoolers as it portrays a positive representation of a high school cishet relationship friendship among girls and (of course) feminism.",5.0,1225
maibritt-589-918706, The double standards are a let down,"Good intentions but I think it falls flat because of the genre confusion and cringy writing. My biggest let down was that sadly this movie doesnt walk the walk itself. Its filled with double standards. It talks about not judging women by their appearances but then has a slo-mo shot of the ""good guy"" pulling up his shirt while skating as the main female characters drool. It doesnt address how good guy Seth is also being portrayed as a hero while litteraly just behaving like a normal human being. That would have been a great way to show how women have to be extraordinary in order to be noticed but men are celebrated for being civil. A lot of the characters are extremely cliché and cringy and I agree that this movie doesnt really work outside of the US. As a European its hard to connect with this genre - the mix between a serious topic and a light vibe doesnt feel like a success with this movie. I recommend that you watch ""Unbelievable"" instead.",5.0,1226

hi-floyd, Had potential but was so poorly written,The concept of the story was very strong but it was so poorly executed by the screenwriters. There were way too many storylines that as a result all fell flat. Moments of the story that were clearly meant to have a lot of emotional weight felt completely empty because there was barely any build up to them. The writers shouldve chosen one of the arcs to focus on and really honed in on that; Kieras storyline wouldve been great for this.If the majority of Moxies attention turned towards working on Kiera winning the scholarship as in they spent lots of time and energy campaigning only to have her lose to Mitchell who only won due to his reputation popularity and generally him just showing up then her loss wouldve hit much harder. Seeing all of the characters cry when she lost felt so forced it was honestly cringy.Also the tokenism was real. It wouldve been so lovely to see the girl in the wheelchair or the transgender girl have a significant role. Instead they just kind of float around on the sidelines not really contributing to the action of the story. The fact that I cant even remember their names is telling. Frankly it felt like they were just shoved in to spice up the story with diversity when really it felt lazy. The transgender girls aspiration to play Audrey in the production of Little Shop of Horrors couldve also been a major storyline a campaign that Moxie really fought for.It is even mentioned that the transgender girl is facing a lot of discrimination and that intersectional feminism is key yet these topics/themes are never picked up again or given the time of day. Again it feels like these parts were just thrown in for the sake of slapping on a diversity badge and then the writers called it a day. It isnt enough. Its time that these characters who represent marginalised demographics actually provide something for the story.Overall it was just a very weak attempt at representing fourth wave feminism and I dont think it did the movement justice. Also it legitimately just like wasnt funny. Like it was meant to be a comedy and genuinely the jokes just werent good. So big nah.,3.0,1228

linda-846-907013, I expected better from Amy Poehler,"The movie was really good at first but it tanked in the end. Nothing was resolved and nothing changed. Pointless property damage stood in for actual change.The principals trophy was a good example. Real change would have been shown by her realizing thanks to the actions of our spunky heroines she was contributing to the problem. Then she looked at that trophy and understood she wasnt the best principal and destroyed it herself.Or the rape accusation - sure its great the girl said it out loud and was believed but does anyone think anything will come of it? We all know what the legal and social system is like. Hell claim its more of the persecution he talked about in the morning announcement segment. Plus the one girl admitting she tripped the guy whos the Pirate mascot? Thats not feminism thats assault.And what did they do when the girl lost the scholarship? Nothing. They didnt find someone to give her another scholarship that was even better. They didnt show the guy giving the scholarship that the soccer team was worth supporting they didnt ask for a count of the votes. It was just forgotten about.Vivian never took responsibility for her unhelpful and cruel actions - we never see her apologize to her mom or her moms boyfriend. She gives a small ""Im sorry"" to Seth but I wasnt convinced.This seemed exceptionally performative and poorly thought out. Rah rah girl power but lets not do anything to actually change the underlying paradigm that has serious flaws.",4.0,1231

lucasespindola-91322," Uninspired, if well intentioned",This is a movie of could haves. It could have been a great flick. It could have been smarter with its depictions of sexism racism and homophobia. But it doesnt. It is a generic movie that simply happens to talk about feminism. And thats it.It is as manichaeist as it gets. The bad guys are constantly bad as irredeemable as possible. The good guys are saints only lacking the halo. Sexism is not shown it is shot like a missile at the scream. Subtlety simply does not exist.The acting is subpar but thats understandable as it relies on mostly young and inexperienced actors.With that it is very hard to stay engaged with it. There is no actual thinking needed as every situation that is presented is black and white. So when it ends itll just fade. It provokes nothing it changes nothing. It could have been but it aint. A bland and boring waste of potential.,5.0,1240

There are just a few parts I dont understand why they were included. Two of the girls kiss once and its never addressed or developed. I understand that they dont want to take away from the overall theme but to me it just felt like a token scene like they threw it in to seem ""woke"".

Doublej20005, An Enjoyable and Uplifting if Flawed Film,This is very much on the nose in its messaging and there are a lot of more complex ways that this subject matter could be explored. The overt and straightforward way that this tackles extremely complex subject matters will definitely not work for some people. But I think the film is definitely aware of this fact and instead tries to create a more upbeat and simple portrayal of feminism and in that regard I think it works well. Amy Poehlers direction is solid the performances are good and the first two acts in particular are pretty enjoyable. I do think the focus should have been more on some of the side characters who all things considered were much more interesting but that doesnt mean that the lead characters arc wasnt pretty strong. It is a bit too long for its own good and again oversimplifies a complicated topic but Id be lying if I didnt say that I had a smile on my face when the credits started to roll. Overall its an uplifting and enjoyable if flawed film and Id definitely recommend it.,7.0,1246
macwright-46529," Good movie, spreads what feminism should be",I just watch this movie today. My thoughts in general are that this movie is a relatively good movie. While I did not feel like I related to this movie with my own high school experience three years ago I know others who would probably say otherwise. This movie gets a really thinking about things and if there are schools that have become just as toxic as the one shown the movie which is entirely possible then this movie holds some truth and reality. There are people who will knock this movie saying its just the classic crazy feminism(the type that says all men are bad and and doesnt shout equality) but this movie I think hits on point of the right type of feminism that promotes unity and respect and equal treatment of women who dont get heard when they speak up.,7.0,1247

drfcx, Good guy Seth,This will go as one of the great high school flicks alongside such films as Easy A Mean girls and the breakfast clubIt leaves the male viewer with an understandably blooded nose but there is a lot to be learnt here. What the audience are exposed to is the very worst and the best of men. Its a bitter pill to swallow from the beginning. But this isnt about the guys its about the girls. United in a growing tour de force behind the guise of a clever high school magazine. The premise is clear and thats a good thing film work was excellent writing was good and covered a lot of issues (though some issues seem to be chucked in there like the writers were ticking things on a checklist). Its fits the feel good factor that all high school films fill and you will most likely feel better educated on a very many social issues. -1 for that weird date scene in the funeral parlor +1 for no CGI helicopters 9/10 timeless classic,9.0,1256

But its the fact that they hate on the fact that the queen in a card game is weaker than the king like what is that going to do?

amesrichards, A film with an identity crisis,I had high hopes for this film which were very quickly dashed. The main problem is that it doesnt know what it is. Is it a teen comedy a coming-of-age tale or a hard-hitting commentary on the systemic sexism and toxic masculinity that persists throughout society? For the most part it is nothing more than a very predictable formulaic teen comedy it just happens to also have a plot that proports to tackle the very vaguely labelled sexism in the protagonists high school. Theres no reference to this being a wider problem it is very much centred entirely around one bad apple in one high school and in doing so dismisses any idea that this might be global systemic issue. Throughout the film we see constant sexual harassment toxic masculinity gaslighting and gross failures from teaching staff in their duty of care thats tantamount to abuse. And yet ironically none of these acts are depicted with the severity they warrant - its all just considered sexism and it largely remains light and funny. Blink and youll mis the trans character who mentions that shes not allowed to audition for a female role in the school play like its just an annoying inconvenience and not a child being discriminated against by her teachers. I did actually blink and miss the same sex kiss between two of the girls. Both really important issues that are introduced and then totally ignored thereafter. But worst of all literally minutes before the end the film decides to get dark and a rape is introduced (just another example of this pesky sexism)! But again after shoehorning in this totally random plot twist minutes before the end again theres no follow up - not one person suggests the victim report it to the police the rapist gets no comeuppance; its not even implied by maybe a shot of a police car approaching the school; hes not even stripped of his scholarship nothing other than the totally inept part-of-the-problem neglectful abusive head mistress calling him to her office! In a film that is claiming to be challenging sexual abuse and misogyny its infuriating that they didnt bother seeing this last-minute addition through to a conclusion that would have supported that message! But hey the victim got to put on a pretty dress and go to a party with her new girlfriends who all show their support by saying they believe her so thank goodness for that! At best disappointing at worst dangerous.,2.0,1262

jacoblevy884, Good teen flick...!,It was refreshing to see a good quality teen flick that wasnt about the main protagonists trying the get laid by prom night... This had some strong female characters and a simple but interesting premise. Fighting back high school style against the social inequalities and sexism that unfortunately still exist today... They could t seem to get any real traction or help from those in the school system that should be there to help... In the trailer you hear the Principal say dont use the word harassment then I have to do a whole heap over paper work. Pathetic to think this may actually be the reality for many young people in need of help in our state school system.The main antagonist captain of the football team although a stereotypical character was needed for the narrative to move at the pace it did. This character was a bit too cartoonish and over the top at times and would have been better if it was played more restrained and realistic.The fact that the main character used an old school paper newsletter to spread her thoughts and get other people on board for the cause was great. You see her manually cutting and pasting words and images to make these cool little booklets then ride down to the local copy place to make photocopies. This could have so easily been done as an on-line blog or similar. But it wouldnt have had the same visual impact as seeing all those high school students socialising by reading and discussing the newsletters content... So good.I felt it finished a bit abruptly and really could have kicked off with an unexpected ending that the audience didnt see coming. As it turns out the ending was fine just too easy and obvious for a film of this nature. If you have seen promising young woman this could have been organised to be a very clever prequel from their high school days...Enjoy...,6.0,1277

dandbhouse, Too light for big issues?,This film attempts to tackle some big issues such as bullying and sexual assault. However it tries to do it with a level of lightness that does not fully work. Should it have been a more serious film? That is a question that needs to be answered by those who watch it. But sometimes serious subjects need to be presented in a more serious fashion. The age group that this is targeted at can take it because they are on the front lines of these issues. The portrayal of strong young adults with a social conscience is never a bad thing.

simplynouo, Misguided and Sloppy,"Ill try to keep this brief.Do not watch this movie. Even worse than sending the wrong message it combines good messages with bad messages and makes no attempt to help the audience tell which is which. The main character is vindictive and petty and never seems to face consequences for her actions; which only further muddies the waters of a movie that is supposed to have a message. Even worse the main characters will often hurt people who are entirely innocent and unrelated to the things that they are trying to change. ""Collateral damage"" if you will.The antagonist is less and less evil throughout the movie and is basically only turns from the rival to the antagonist at the end of the movie because he does something really evil entirely out of left field. This only further tries to cement the message that the main character is the moral person because by comparison their antagonist is worse.For a movie like this that is supposed to have a message it is very thoroughly misguided. I do not recommend watching it or showing it to those impressionable.",2.0,1282
Dog-River," Good Message, But Poorly Executed",I like female empowerment movies. So I was intrigued by the plot and because of Amy Poehler. It is watchable and the end scene was a somewhat empowering moment (aside from the girl who randomly admitted to tripping the mascot thats not feminism). I feel the script didnt do the topic justice. I think it had the potential to be a great movie but the script felt very robotic and like it was written by an amateur writer. In this story the subject was just thrown into your face rather than giving it depth.The principal was written too one dimensionally for instance as to where it wasnt believable. I also found the lead teen a bit irritating at times. Yes its an important issue but the dinner scene with her mother and her new boyfriend was cringe and made me lose a lot of respect for the character. She acted like an immature child and her mother literally didnt even tell her to stop once at the table until she stormed off to her room. Things didnt go well for her at the time but theres no reason to act like a spoiled brat. Not even an apology to her mother was shown. Also the List that was going around school wouldve resulted in an automatic suspension in the real world today. All in all its worth watching and it has a good message but needed improvements.,4.0,1283

kirdoma, Mehh...,This movie is just boring. A lot of the scenes are just stupid and most of the drama is cringey. Felt like they got a script for a straight-to-dvd childrens movie and tried to make it into a serious film. A lot of the actors seem alright but a lot of the dialog was just bad. Some of the actors/characters (the girl and Tyshawn) seemed out of place but thats mostly on the director. Cinematography was very nice but that doesnt fix the bad writing dull plot line and poor directing.,2.0,1290
brandenthanadabouth, b reviews NH,"North Hollywood (2020) is the directorial debut of Mikey Alfred the creative director and founder of the first teen movie studio and skateboard/clothing brand Illegal Civilization is a film that I have been anticipating for a while now especially since this was produced by Pharrell Williams. NH is a biopic centered around Mikey a high school water polo player/alter boy set on his course of being a pro skateboarder. This isnt without its obstacles as his dad and others mostly Mikey himself get in his way of achieving his dream. I had the pleasure of attending one of the live stream dates and it felt like such a unique occasion as everything has transitioned to some sort of virtual platform. Least to say that this was a very cool experience for me and Im sure the rest of the viewers. This movie is not the best movie out. I was definitely expecting more from the Illegal Civ group but what I saw was an elongated Illegal Civ YT video. I love music dont get me wrong and music heavily influences the films that I script-write but a lot of it seemed unnecessary. Some transitions seemed like they were in there because they ""looked and sounded cool"" which they did but totally threw off the whole tempo of the film. The acting was subpar especially from Ryder. I love you bro but you definitely have a long way to go. I will say that some of the performances where very surprising to me Angus Nico Armais all really well done by them. The scene with Gillian Jacobs was great. I just have problems with the main cast. Miranda Cosgrove didnt really add much for me as Mikeys love interest. Not very compelling when she was on screen. Vince Vaughn as Mikeys dad had his moments however there were parts where it was hard to distinguish his ""caring"" moments from his ""lecture"" moments. I think this was a great casting job however but I think this leads into one of my main gripes with the movie being the script. There were parts in this movie where it felt very natural however there would be little instances of what I call ""novel dialogue"" sounding like someone is reading from a novel which really throws thing off during the watch. There were some technical issues when it came to rack focusing but overall the cinematography was very classic Illegal Civ which is a good thing as it is unique to them. It is a beautifully shot movie the set designs the fits where all very well done. Overall I see the potential I really do but this film left more to be desired. The editing choices the acting the script really slid this film of the rails for me. I will be looking out for more films by Illegal Civ however because you guys are sick and I love what you are doing! Keep at it!",4.0,1291

adiohater, Mikey Alfred Has Struck Lightning in a Bottle,"Set against a backdrop of a sun-kissed San Fernando Valley Mikey Alfreds North Hollywood acts as a heartfelt love letter both the neighborhood of North Hollywood and the art form of skateboarding. Having followed Alfreds journey with the distribution of North Hollywood for over a year I was ecstatic to finally see the end result and I was not disappointed at all.For those who arent aware Mikey Alfred has been building quite an impressive resume for over a decade now. Most notably starting the skate team turned clothing line now production company Illegal Civilization at the age of twelve. Since then Alfred has gone on to be the touring videographer for artists like Frank Ocean Tyler The Creator Kendrick Lamar just to name a few. Hes directed countless music videos short films all while running Illegal Civilization. If hes not already a household name hes going to be in the next five to ten years Im calling that now.Alfreds directorial debut North Hollywood follows Mikey (Ryder McLaughlin) a high school senior dead-set on becoming a pro skater while his father Oliver (Vince Vaughn) believes he wants whats best for Mikey; to go to college and follow the ""traditional"" route of life after adolescence. Mikey attempts to find a balance in spending time with his two best friends Jay (Nico Hiraga) and Adolf (Aramis Hudson) pursue a career in skateboarding build a relationship with his love interest Rachel (Miranda Cosgrove) all while the father-son relationship between Oliver and Mikey is suffering as a result.Having been personally invested in Illegal Civilization and Mikey Alfreds creative endeavors for years now it was clear how important it was for North Hollywood to be made not only to those involved but to the skateboarding community as a whole. The year leading up to this release Alfred was not shy to talk about his deep appreciation for old hollywood. Commonly dropping names like Robert Evans or Martin Scorsese in interviews. Now having seen North Hollywood all of those mentioned influences are extremely apparent specifically in the cinematography. Throughout the film youll notice these beautifully wide panoramic shots as they seamlessly flow down and around the scene setting. This ends up being a two-birds-one-stone situation paying homage to the visual elegance and theatrical elements seen in the previously mentioned influences as well as acting as a visual representation of skateboarding to an extent its all in the flow of a scene.Theres something very different about the coloring and texture of North Hollywood as well. The only way I can accurately describe it is rich. Not rich in the sense that its overbearing or distracting but in the sense that its clear just how much love Alfred has for his town and skating. While this might come across as poetic I interpreted the rich color palettes as a visual representation of the passion a filmmaker has for the subject matter.I could go on and on about North Hollywood but the bottom line is that this being Mikey Alfreds feature length debut he knocked it out of the park. The passion behind this project and the subject matter comes through crystal clear which is all you can ask for as a filmmaker. I cant wait to see what Illegal Civilization has coming in the future and can only hope they get to work with the same crew because they struck lightning in a bottle with North Hollywood.",9.0,1295
nixongallardo, Greatest movie of all time,I fell in love with this movie and it has become my favorite. What made me so attracted to this movie was the relatability. I remember sitting in the car anxiously waiting for the movie to start and having a conversation with my friends about skating and a few minutes later that exact conversation was brought up in the movie. We all just looked at each other and started laughing. The movie made me feel at home. Like how no other movie has ever made me feel. The intro to this movie was as powerful as the intro to a Star Wars movie. This movie will always be my all time favorite.,10.0,1296
elianleal, A movie for the family,Went to watch this movie with my dad. We both enjoyed it and related to the movie in our own ways. He opened up after the movie talking about how he wanted support from his dad to be a pro soccer player. I related to the movie bc my parents always wanted me to go to college and I felt differently. The movie has some universal themes that everyone encounters at one point in life. Aside from great characters and engaging dialogue the conflicts in the film really sell the movie. The mistakes and conflicts feel real instead of just another part of the movie. It makes the movie feel more like youre watching a version of yourself. That makes the film that much more engaging because theres some wisdom to be learned by the end of all the chaos. Great movie. Anyone who likes movies (and even some who dont) wont be disappointed.,10.0,1297

MaximilianSchuldt, Interesting and unique,This is Mikey Alfred of Illegal Civs debut Film and it was a pleasure to watch. You can really tell that this movie was made with love even though the plot felt a bit too short and rushed at times. The visuals and way the movie was shot is spot on and the actors all did a good job. I can feel that Mikey Alfred has a long career in front of him if he continues with the same potential. All in all a good movie and honestly just worth watching even if you dont skate.,8.0,1299
fr9070, North Hollywood: Good effort but ultimately lacking,This one is going to hurt because of how much I love Illegal Civ and the entire cast of this movie however this movie is very boring and it leaves you confused and maybe even angry. I payed the 18$ to watch it before it was released on iTunes and I can wholeheartedly say I wish I would have waited. The character was so hard to root for that I started to enjoy watching his life become a mess. Good actors are totally wasted and theres massive parts of the movie that are super dumb and have no purpose in furthering the plot. Like the lame scene with the joke that fails and all the homies are shaking their heads. Also the scene at that sketchy apartment when he gets beat up. This movie is so highly rated because all the kids who cant think critically dont want to seem like haters and actually admit the movie sucked. Its cool that this was made by skaters for skater starring skaters but when it comes to being a movie this was atrocious. With that being said I think Mikey has great potential and Im excited to see what future projects he releases.,2.0,1300
twclark-49465, A fun movie.,The movie is fun! Its not supposed to be a Scorsese film with layers on top of layers of plot. Its a coming of age movie about skateboarding with its obvious flaws its really not that deep.,7.0,1301
stinkyfishe-81213, IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!,I traveled to LA to see this movie specifically and I was not disappointed. The idea of how they showed the film was genius because it was a social distanced event due to them changing it to be a drive-in theater event. I have to say that the idea of using Doordash was a good idea but in the end it took a long time to receive whatever you ordered. In the end it was an amazing experience that I will never forget and I am excited to see when others can see the hard work that was put in this film and the art in it.,10.0,1302
brandychase-17981, NORTH HOLLYWOOD HAS AN AUDIENCE,Just was at the Premiere yesterday and I thought it was amazing. The cinematography was impressive considering its Mikey Alfreds debut film.

I didnt go into it expecting a PG film.Overall I was satisfied with how it ended. Waiting for it to be released to the public. NOHO has an audience.,10.0,1303

Carpathia007, What did I just watch?,Im very confused as the movie did not seem to have a plot. Very artistic style in filming but the writing felt underwhelming and the dialogue most certainly was not family friendly as it seems that the vocabulary was limited to curse words for the majority of the film. Vaughn had a few funny lines but thats about all this film had going for it. Overall I dont plan on watching it again.,1.0,1305
hammyham-13843, The movie to watch if you love illegal civ.,Im gonna keep this short and straight to the pointThis is Mikey alfreds first time as a director and for the first time its great. However some of the writing especially Miranda cosgroves writing felt very unnatural and it felt like she was reading a script and trying to put emotion behind it. On the other hand in my opinion Ryder Aramis Angus Cloud all were very surprised me in their abilities Nico Hiraga was good dont get me wrong just some of his like delivery was very strange.The story is simple and straight to the point it also doesnt waste anytime from the very beginning he wants to be a pro skater and he strives for it.Overall a very good film for a debut and Im excited to see where this team and this director goes in the future.,7.0,1306
ajaxlepinski, WHAT A GREAT FILM!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!,North Hollywood is a truly wonderful movie. The script casting directing acting cinematography etc. etc. etc. is exemplary. While watching I became very involved and by the end of the film I was so choked up that my wife felt the need to ask if I was OK... I had difficulty speaking! The movie brought back many feelings memories and experiences that I had back in junior and senior high school. I dont expect everyone to have the same reaction; I wasnt a skateboarder but I related a bit too closely to Ryder McLaughlins characters struggle to make sense of the world around him. North Hollywood is a very entertaining and an amazingly human movie. I give it 10 stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up!,10.0,1307

r34lz, It's alright. The cinematography was the best quality of this film.,I liked the way it was filmed - the composition and even the lens they used but the story felt unfinished. I think the film should have been longer or have a better ending. I wanted to see the main character make a part and get sponsored or win a contest and see his dad waiting for him to bring home the money and the trophy. The ending was just not satisfactory. The dialogues alright. The friendship between the three friends was portrayed realistically. Thats one thing that was done right in this film. As I mentioned before the one thing that made this film enjoyable was the cinematography. That wide lens look is what kept me from looking away. I would love to see more films shot with a wide lens.Overall the film was just alright. I think if Illegal Civ keeps making more films they might be on to something.,7.0,1310
mwjarrett-59631, Good for Mikeys first time,Overall I thought the movie was solid if you like Illegal Civ and you have watched some of their videos before than youll appreciate what this movie is. But this movie was all over the place there was multiple stories I felt with not enough detail to them and some of the actors lines felt very pushed ahead instead of having time for the actors to fully grow. The one thing that I could compare this to is Illegal Civ Summer 17 it felt like a longer movie version of that series.,6.0,1311
benkirilo, features carry this film,Horth hollywood is good but if you followed the films production underwhelming. Most of the feedback for this film is from a very niche crowd who love illegal civ and therefore love the movie. Famous skaters and spots distract fans from the piss poor dialogue and average and ultimately pointless story.North hollywood is a boring coming of age story with culture. Its worth the watch if you are a fan like myself but otherwise i couldnt convinve you to care. Its a painful review to leave because i love mikey and ic but this movie is just not that good.,5.0,1312

The male friendships highlighted in this film are unlike any other Ive seen--genuine and raw. The character of Rachel was the definition of a women who can advocate for herself and had depth/purpose in Michaels journey to become pro. The performances by both Amaris and Ryder were absolutely incredible. Great job IC and congrats Mikey.,10.0,1326
b-ere-94, North Hollywood is a film as timeless and universal as any other coming-of-age tale,Its been some time waiting for this film to be available for us living outside of the US but it was definitely worth the wait. You can feel the work that has been put in while making the film a sense of community and collaboration unlike much else. Its nice to watch a film focusing on skating where the people behind the camera actually understands skating and how to accurately portray it. North Hollywood takes place in a specific environment but its core is just as universal and timeless as any other coming-of-age tale and for many viewers this will be their life/story finally told on screen. Ill leave the rating 9/10 as of now since I feel like I need to watch the film a second time to really settle on a rating. However just going by my heart its a win across all boards.UPDATE: Well I just watched it again and Im just going to bump this up to a 10/10. Theres so much heart and vibrancy in this film and Im just so glad projects like this actually can get made today in this scale. If someone out there is still thinking this film doesnt have an audience youre a fool.,10.0,1327
safagegr, SOMETHING I WOULD BE PROUD TO TELL MY KIDS I WAS APART OF GAME CHANGING AF,This movie has been something ive been waiting on for a while and i kid you not im farther then satisfied. This movie not only shows the audience the grind and risks there is to follow your skating dreams but also for anything your passionate for. Mikey and the whollleeeee crew has said multiple times that they want to inspire and to be that catalyst for people to pick there board back up or to go make a movie just like he did or to follow your dreams whatever that may be. The acting was top notch especially because not a lot of them are actual actors. The lil poem Ryder said at the end was soooo wholesome really teared up. And yes yes i did stay up till 5am but it was 100% worth it. It definitely hit home when your parents/guardians doubt you on your decisions which make you doubt yourself and you loose hope. But if anything this movie has gave back that hope. Thank you IC for this amazing opportunity much love and follow your dreams guys.,10.0,1328
louiecouv, Fresh Breath / Tell your Family,"Although Im a big supporter for Illegal Civ & their amazing content from merchandise to videos i tried keeping an unbiased view on Noho. When you bring big names like Vince Vaughn Miranda Cosgrove and producers like Pharrell Williams & Noah Centineo it made me wonder what they will deliver to the table. What Mikey Alfred did for North Hollywood was put those pieces mixed in with his Illegal Civ cast and it was orchestrated beautifully. This movies was authentic to its core. Tight Script great production design stellar cinematography beautiful soundtrack (still waiting for the track-list) and a cast that gave it a Go Big or Go Home mentality. Such heartfelt performances that prove these actors have a big future. It was a Fresh Breath of portraying teenagers in a feature film. For an Illegal Civ fan it felt like a continuation of Summer of 17 fused with GODSPEED & IC3 but with its own script and a budget. For a movie go-er North Hollywood set a bar when it comes to independent film making. Illegal Civ changed my life and got me into skating and I cant imagine what it will do for generations to come. Big Shoutout to Mikey Alfred for capturing the essence of skating & teenage life.Lets hope there are more screenings to show to my whole family. Watching this with my friends was an unreal moment but I feel that watching it with family members who dont understand the concept of skating will get something out of this. Every skater at one point has experienced the ""skating is pointless"" or ""skating is for bums"" talk from their parents. What North Hollywood does is show the pros & cons of skating with perspectives from the skater family friends & lovers. Many blessings to the Cast & Crew behind Illegal Civ & everyone surrounding it. They have a gem of a movie that will mean something for kids. I hope theres a DVD box set to show the kids in the future.Thank you Illegal Civilization for the amazing film!",9.0,1329

North Hollywood combines skating struggles with friendships love and finding your way in life. North Hollywood does so perfectly.

franpepperrell, Mikey is so cool,The movie has such a distinct aesthetic that is so exciting to watch. The soundtrack the cinematography the writing so good.I thought that Michael was such an interesting character to watch develop and how you dont necessarily have to root for him. Its a very refreshing take on the whole loveable anti-hero thing. Mikey also does a great job of establishing the relationship between the Michael and his father. Vince Vaughn is incredible as Michaels pops I wont spoil it but the scene when he takes Michael to work and talks aside to one of his employees... Kind of terrifying.Its also super funny in a way thats of understated. It was really nice to see Ryder Aramis and Nico all together like in The Fader Summer of 17 mini series. They have great chemistry.The film is huge achievement and I think that Mikey has the same aura that Miyazaki had. Its like whenever you watch a Studio Ghibli film and everything just makes sense and comes together. By the end of NOHO the film had that same feeling. That everything the characters go through and all the paths they end up on are valid. Mikey does such an amazing job of conveying this and its definitely going to be my new comfort film...,9.0,1333
ellapark-93530, INSPIRING.,I just finished watched about five minutes ago and I have never felt more inspired.The soundtrack the shots the plot. All of it. North Hollywood is beautifully and meticulously crafted. It radiates an aura of youthfulness and playfulness yet immense passion and expertise that I think captures the essence of modern skate culture perfectly. This film is not only an interesting an intimate lens into skate culture but a relatable story for young people pursuing what they love.At the end of the online premiere I just attended the chat space with other viewers was full of people talking about how they felt inspired and wished each other the best for the rest of their life. Not only does this highlight the community and relatability (between especially young people) that was created through this film I feel as though it evokes the impact North Hollywood intended to have on every single audience member to inspire individuals who can inspire more. North Hollywood is a film by the first teen movie studio that has inspired me to get my act together and work for what I want and motivate others to do the same. Im gonna be big one day and this just pushed me one step further. Giving yall a nine because we can only go up. IC 4L. Bravo.,9.0,1334
tsunnye, NoHo is an unmatched experience,Firstly congrats to Mikey and the IC team for finally releasing a truly amazing film. This movie is unique in characters storyline and cinematography. It really is a beautiful piece.The actors chosen for each role were arguably perfect. There were a few big celebrities such as Vince Vaughn and Miranda Cosgrove but most of the people acting in this movie are a part of IC. Keeping it close to home creates a comfortable feeling while still going big with the known actors.The storyline was less perfect but definitely still worth watching. There were some moments that you cant help but smile at because it reminds you of your own memories. There was even a scene where I cried- it hit home for me in many ways. Which goes back to relatability. This movie is very much relatable. Every kid who skates thinks about going pro at least once. And many try their luck later on. There is coming of age drama and comedy; very versatile and interesting.The best part of the film (for me) by far are the pictures. This movie is produced extremely well. The love that the crew put into this film is seen very well throughout the entire piece. From the clean skate shots to the stunning close up scenes NoHo does not falter in the category of cinematography. The video style can definitely be described as indy while still incorporating bigger concepts to move the film along nicely.Overall this film is well written and beautifully executed. Like others have said it is bound to become a sleepover-classic and many peoples favorite movie. It certainly wasnt what I was expecting in the best way possible. A perfectly pleasant surprise. So thank you again Mikey and the IC team for putting together such an amazing movie that I will definitely watch over and over again. I recommend this to anyone and everyone no matter if you skate or not.,10.0,1335
samismidah, a masterclass from Mikey Alfred,Easily my favourite film of the year so far has a perfect balance of humour drama heart-touching scenes and an aesthetic that shines throughout the entire movie. The soundtrack is unreal and you can sense Mikeys Scorsese influence which he mentioned in a previous IC video. The cinematography is stellar and perfectly captures the tone of the scenes. No spoilers but one scene hit so close to home that it made me tear up. A love letter to North Hollywood the LA skate scene and skateboarding in general and filmmaking. A must watch for any aspiring skateboarders or filmmakers or anyone with doubts about pursuing their dream.MORE MIKEY MORElove to the cast and crew.,9.0,1336

The director Mikey Alfred & the whole team did a perfect job executing everything.,9.0,1339
lukebrecken, Works extremely well for what it was,I think to truly enjoy this film you have to go into it knowing what it is. From the announcement to the preview at Camp Flog Gnaw to the videos and Instagram posts explaining NoHo journey the build up and hype makes it that much better. Now for the actual film it was very well shot with effortless and flowing transitions Mikey and his team did a phenomenal job on the presentation and boring work to make this film look good.Also the sets and costumes in this movie and bright and vibrant with the exception of a couple scenes. These choices really help set the mood. Another strong feature is the soundtrack (perhaps its strongest) the ability to have The Chiffons and Baby Keem fit in the same movie is really a testament to the diversity and range of the film. The story speaks for itself in my opinion. It shows the strains achieving your goals can have on your relationships. This is also one of the only movies that accurately portrays the skateboarding industry possibly the only one. Moving on to the characters I enjoy the development of Mikey (Ryder McLaughlin); how he starts off as a likable kid but by the middle he almost annoys you because youre hoping hell realizing hes acting like a jerk but he doesnt. Then in the end Mikey finally redeems himself and wins back the audience. Oliver (Vince Vaughn) Mikeys dad accurately portrays the attitude of parents towards their children when they arent going down the path they had mapped out for them. Every scene Oliver was in was great and Vince was perfect for this role. Adolf (Aramis Hudson) was probably my favorite character I really respected his loyalty. Rachel (Miranda Cosgrove) was one of the weaker characters in my opinion her dialogue seemed lacking and awkward at points maybe Mikey intended for this to be the case to in a way draw the line of main and side character. There are more great cameos by Nico Hiraga Angus Cloud Thomas Barbusca Blake Anderson Tyshawn Jones and probably my favorite besides Adolf Jason Dill as a priest. While I feel like this movie had strong and relatable characters I do feel like at times the dialogue could have been enriched with more emotion. But then again this is a minor issue that to most viewers will be overlooked. Overall North Hollywood was a spectacular film that I along with many others will be able to enjoy forever and will look back on it as a classic of our generation. I cant wait to see what Mikey and Illegal Civ have planned next.,10.0,1340

daquezada-41702, North Hollywood great movie,For months I was debating on watching the movie when I finally watched it I fell in love with the dialogue and message to all the viewers that no matter what parents will support you. The cinematography was great and the chemistry between the characters/ actors was extraordinary. So if you wanted to watch it I highly recommend it.,10.0,1344
juboy70, Thought the reviews seemed dubious... I was wrong,OK its clear that somebody has mobilised a social media following to give North Hollywood 10/10 reviews but after watching the film Id actually say that score is not far from the reality.The film looks stunning from start to finish and the performances are surprisingly solid across the board. Special merit has to go to Vince Vaughn who once again demonstrates hes become one of the finest actors of his generation.Thoroughly enjoyed this film it really is a joy to watch and probably the best praise I can give it is that I was actually quite upset when it ended. It could have gone on much longer I wish it had.,9.0,1345

It really showed a great perspective of skateboarding for people who dont skate such as parents or for an audience that doesnt understand skate culture as much. Congrats mikey and everyone else who was apart of the film. I appreciated being an extra in this film to see how you did everything behind the scenes was amazing. Great energy! The progress ive noticed from watching your short films years ago to you making North Hollywood is insanely motivating and inspiring and i cant wait to see whats next.,10.0,1356
jackbowman-62862, Really hit home for me!,As a teenager today I could really empathize with Michaels struggles of friendship love and passion. I felt his pain and anxiety throughout the whole movie but at the same time could see both sides of the argument between his friends and family. Not only that but a lot of the things Micheal experienced I somewhat experienced myself the troubles of having a girlfriend and a best friend at the same time having your family want you to do something you didnt wanna do and drifting away from close friends. Near the end when Micheal and Adolf made up and hugged I teared up a bit because something exactly the same happened to me once but me and my past friend never made up so it really made me think of him and how we both should have changed and learned and grew together. I also could feel Michaels passion to be cool and hangout with pros and having a friend who is just a loser again I went through the same thing. I could really tell that the people making this movie understood being a skater and being a teenager and how tough it is. I also thought that the actor was superb Vince Vaughn and the lead cast did incredible in their roles and I could feel the tension while watching. The only critiques I really have are from a director stand point like how some of the scenes are a little misplaced or filmed funny. In all I loved this movie and have already watched it twice today. I recommend it to anyone who is or once was a skater in their teen years.,9.0,1357

alinasalceda, NORTH HOLLYWOOD,I really really loved the meaning behind this movie. Ive watched all of these guys for years so its always good seeing them improve and be in more movies. This film holds a special place in my heart because yall made it together and on your own you guys did it with people that you love. Ryder played his part very good and i think that it was important for him to stick up to his dad and do what he loves (because many people find that hard to do) I couldnt have asked for a better cast so thank you guys for picking who you did!! This movie is going to teach a lot of younger people to stand up for what they believe in and to go after anything they dream. Skating is big for many people and its hard to keep a steady mind when ur trying to make yourself known! I loved this movie just wish it was longer. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing this. <3.,10.0,1361
alextran-34913, Great flick,The cast was just superb. I loved the cinematics and minor details in the background. And the whole coming of age vibes is nice. I give it 9/10 only because $19 is kinda steep just to watch it live with no replay functions. I had to use the toilet in the middle of it and missed a huge portion of the film.

My grandpa who grew up in North Hollywood thought this movie was phenomenal he could even tell where of the scenes where located. He grew up in noho skating and he loved to see that people were still representing the skate culture in North Hollywood. Now my 13 year old self thought this movie was amazing Ryder and Angus will be big names in this industry Im telling you! The fact that you showed the true feelings taht parents have with skate culture was phenomenal. I mean just theses last few months I realized I dont really want to be a doctor anymore I want to film skate I WANT TO BE MIKEY!! AND THE FACT THAT HE WROTE A CHARACTER THAT CHECKED ALL OF MY BOXES MADE THIS A MOIVE EVERY SKATER CAN RELATE TOO! This is a movie that I would watch over and over again!

Mid 90s of course another beautiful skate flick. We will take any big budget skate film of course but to have North Hollywood is to have THE perfect skate film. My soul was hugged by this movie.

adinathdr, Multiple-real-life-cybercrime inspired-thriller stories in one movie,Operation JavaWhats happening in Mollywood ? Like seriously? Cant believe all this top class versatile movies are happening in one shot. Pretty much they have already compensated well for the loss of 2020. Vellam Love Drishyam 2 and now operation Java? Operation JavaIts the first movie with MULTIPLE-REAL LIFE -CYBER CRIME inspired thriller stories in a SINGLE movie. Since the movie love and this still hasnt got much attention even after getting a 4/5 from I. E. I wanna draw your attention to these highlights. The movie has even included premam pirate leak tamil rockers and much moreNow a few people out there when they get bored with one portion says the movie is lagging. Well thats their choice. But for me thats the calmness before the stormThis movie also has such a phase where the director dives into defining the personal lives of the characters so that they can connect better to us. And thats just the director leaving his foot off the clutch to give full throttle to the movie. Jakes Bejoys killer bgm plays..Since this movie is inspired from real events its also shot as a NATURAL THRILLER (one of its kind) and not as a CINEMATIC THRILLER like drishyam-2. And most importantlyIm soo much satisfied with the movies which doesnt have popular stars cz they would draw most of the attention. Which is why movies like this can connect you directly to the story/characters. I do recommend this movie to be watched in big screen for the full experience. -D. R. Adinath.,9.0,1389

pm_unnikrishnan, Keeps us fully engaged.,There is never a dull moment in this movie except for maybe that one song sequence. This manages to make us feel convinced that this is how cyber police in Kerala works. We dont feel like any tech stuff they show is out of place. That is all one needs to ask from such a movie. When most movies show tech stuff in an incorrect way this is breath of fresh air. It feels grounded in reality.At times it resembled Action Hero Biju. They have stitched together the investigation of several unrelated cyber crime cases in a seamless manner. Its told through the eyes of the two heroes. The story progresses through their viewpoint.The script doesnt lag anywhere. The comic relief we get is not at all forced and feels very organic.The acting is very good. There is no one who did their part in a bad way.The art costumes editing departments too did a commendable job.The only problem I found was that there was a bit too much of melodrama in it. The heroes always seem like they are not at all happy about what they got.If you want to watch an entertaining film which doesnt have any dull moment in it go for this.,7.0,1391
sudheeshthulaseedharan, Scripting Excellent. Making it's a step ahead.,Even before its release the film made a huge splash with trailers teasers in YouTube!The film tells the story of Anthony George and Vinayak Das who go from Salem to become courier boys and food delivery boys without getting a permanent job after engineering.Balu Varghese and Lukman Avaran are the B Tech cyber youngsters in the lead role. Lukman takes the field to another level with his eloquence in a crucial scene that presents an emotional storyline through dialogue.But the film does not revolve around them it goes completely through the script and the making.The film begins with Alphonses sons Premam becoming a huge success and its censor copy being leaked on the internet.Antony and Vinayak Das are approaching SHO Prathap of the Cyber Wing in Kochi with the conclusion that the route found by the police is not behind it.The first part of Java is that the inspector impressed by these guys ability conducts the investigation the way they say.The film falls on track from the very first frame as it is an investigation of an incident that is familiar and interesting to the Malayalee.Gathering the audience as well. Java can be used from the beginning to create the impression that it can do justice to the hype received onlineRealistic and smart cyber police operations make the film worthwhile.The director manages to keep the audience curious throughout the operation. Nowhere does it seem like the work of a newcomer says Tarun Murthy.Scripting Excellent. Making its a step ahead.You can feel the exact homework behind it on the screen.Operation Java is another film in which a talented director emphasizes that actors are not an essential element.As mentioned earlier it is not the path of these two that is advancing in the investigative paths of cyber policing.Irshad has the full versatility of a cyber-wing station head. Binu Pappu and Prashant Alexander performed well.Operation Java came to an unexpected end.The compulsion to be realistic keeps the dramatic expectations of the traditional audience at bay.The film ends with the submission of millions of temporary / contract basic / daily wage employees in the Kingdom of India.A dedication that hooks somewhere inside.,7.0,1392

nidhunmoviebuff," A brilliant, realistic crime thriller based on true events!",#MovieReview #OperationJava #SpoilerFreeDirector Tharun Moorthy has delivered Malayalams best crime thriller since Anjaam Paathira effectively blending together three slice-of-life police investigations to deliver a stylish end product.Lookman and Balu Varghese star as a duo of down-on-their-luck engineering grads who land a temporary internship with the Police Cyber cell using their wit and tenacity.Their efforts in unravelling a set of cunning online crimes and financial frauds form the rest of the story and the fact that these are inspired by real events adds further sheen.The directors dedication to portray the story in as realistic a manner as possible is what makes Operation Java such an excellent watch.Highly recommended.,8.0,1394

sreenesh-g-one, Operation Java: Successful,"Inspired from cases that were reported under the Cyber Cell department throughout the country Operation Java opens several investigation files fictionizes it and takes us through these cases from the point of view of Antony and Dasan. Striving to make a living through casual jobs Antony and Dasan dream of making it big someday but they just dont make it to the shore. To the duo clinging on to the lead they had found in an interesting case is their only ""escape from reality"". The Director focuses on two issues here; cyber-crime and unemployment and brings about an equal balance in both core elements. While the subjects of cyber-crimes reveal how frightening and cunning certain Humans can be the light that falls on Antony and Dasan and their lives make you empathetic and feel pity for them. I felt the first act of the screenplay to be the most interesting and entertaining whereas better casting and a proper ending wouldve uplifted Operation Angel. Also with most of the shots being single takes as an audience you feel as if you are one among the group of officers which is a huge plus point in keeping the audience engaged and to add to this engagement there is beaty music from Jakes Bejoy kicking it up a notch. There have been plenty of movies and TV shows that dealt with financial frauds scams and cyber-crimes. Operation Java is a mix of these movies and TV shows with a home ground script and by home ground what I meant is how much the language audience can relate to. Malayalam cinema yet again proves that it does not need big names on the poster to attract the audience content is always king in this industry.",7.0,1396

The lead is supposed to have 56000 hours of flight time which is also ridiculous showing me how bad the writers actually are.56000 hours is 24 hours per day 7 days a week for over 6 YEARS...In the end it is a silly implausible movie that you will forget moments after you watch it.Not Recommended.,4.0,1418
muhanado, You won't leave happy,I watched it because the trailer looked cool. Im a sucker for good action plus I like watching Anthony Mackie movies. That said this movie was so blah. Harp the protagonist is just so boring to the point of being annoying. Less than half way through and I couldnt stand listening to him talk. There are some good action scenes and CGI work but the story just sucked and was so cliche. I cant imagine anyone leaving being happy they spent 2 hours of their life watching this movie but if you need something to pass the time sure.,4.0,1419

elliotte2, All over the place,Pros:Anthony Mackie is a very good actor and possesses a screen presence.Several of the action scenes are engaging.Cons:Everything elseProtagonist acting is way off. It is the Kneau Reeves/Kristen Stewart off.Writing is a step beyond high school with dialogue that is laughable.Logic is nonsensical where people walking and people driving a car very fast are reaching the same destination at the same time(and they both left the same time).Plot is early James Bond level of over the top.Editing is patched together so loosely that you barely realize what is going onLastly there appears to be no security at military bases villian hideouts billion dollar laboratories.,4.0,1421
sebapamula, Makes no sense,The main character has to be a hero but hes actually scared of everything. Besides that they couldve killed the cyborg with the drone while following him. I dont know why he went into the nuclear missile silo at the end as they pretended to blow it up after all anyway. Besides that he makes it out alive while 4 nuclear war heads explode. The moral of the story should be that humanity is good but I actually agreed with the cyborg that the UN is causing wars all over the world while pretending theyre bringing peace.,3.0,1422
boryagin," robots were cool, acting was funny",Robots in action were cool.Otherwise it was just a funny piece. Black native Ukrainians speaking American English to black American soldiers. I am not even going into all the mess with scenery and language. Those are understood.The main character is completely out of sync with his role and supposed mentality. Army officers behave like teenage campers. Combat scenes so flawed that its apparent even to a civilian like me.So you can watch it if you got nothing else to do. With a bottle of beer or a glass of whiskey. Not a genuine cinematic experience. Dont expect too much.,6.0,1423
jon626537, If you have absolutely nothing else to watch then maybe consider this,I really dont get it. Netflix throws thousands into movie production (and increases our subscription fees as a result!) Bringing in big names such as MCUs Anthony Mackie but the film is just dull. You dont connect with any of the characters the script is worse than a Boris Johnson COVID update and the screenplay just leaves you empty.If youre an absolute aficionado of war movies with a little bit of Chappie thrown in then you may just enjoy it. I got to 40 minutes left in the movie and started to consider to switch it off.Tell you what Netflix instead of just trying to click air people with big Hollywood names why not invest in decent scriptwriters and directors?Boring.,2.0,1424
andrewrye-06535, Senseless Rubbish,This movie made no sense and had so many plot holes and stupid moments.Where to begin?A 19 yr old Lieutenant who claims he has 56000 hours flight experience (work it out) disobeys a direct order so gets sent on a secret mission retaining his rank. A robot in the form of a man who can withstand direct shots to the chest with armour piercing rounds no problem but complains it hurts when a tracker is cut out of his back. Can reason make cynical jokes and make decisions (really need to think how that isnt a good thing). When you run out of ammo throw away your very expensive US military issue auto gun despite standing next to the jeep you arrived in.Apparently auto makers lost the ability to further designs after 2020.There are plenty more questionable things about this movie like why did I watch it3 because its a sunny day,3.0,1425
daniel-nordqvist-eqe08, Decent Single A Action movie,"Probably not something youre going to re-watch but for me it was enjoyable.If you want something new this may not be the right choice the general story is pretty standard:Newbie gets to the camp meets more experienced mentor experiences combat handles it badly for a while twist he ends up on his own and somehow completes the mission.There are some cool parts to the story though. Most notably for me was the parallel between Leo and the standard combat drones.He more or less wants the US to consider the consequences to their new weapon systems thats why he does what he does. You can see it throughout the movie including the collateral damage from drone strikes but more interesting is the fact that their combat robots have a tendency to fire first.Sure their targets are armed and behaving in a threatening manner. But as demonstrated by Leo defusing the situation by the relief truck it doesnt have to end with a firefight.Theres also an interesting parallel between them sending a drone pilot to experience combat in order to understand what happens when they fire a missile and the US learning the consequences of their weapons by one of those weapons turning against them. Thats why Leo *MUST* be the one to do it.All in all a solid film. But it does suffer from some boneheaded mistakes including: the protagonist having over 56000 flight hours thats 6 years 24/7 or 18 years full time. As such I would expect him to be in his late thirties at least but I dont think the character was more than 25...The Balkans being mentioned frequently despite the movie taking place in Ukraine some 600 miles and several countries away. And sure that one can be handwaved away most of the time they are referring to a person ""the terror of the Balkans"" and therefore not technically wrong. But throughout the movie it seems like they are referring to that title as if it has local significance...",7.0,1426

kosmasp, Entangled in the Wire(?),"Or just ... plain wired? Now visually and technically in general Id say there is not much one can critisize here. On the story part though ... or at least the coherent storytelling ... thats a different story (no pun intended). This really is quite a stretch to say the least. And while Mackie does his best to keep the audience engaged (together with the rest of the cast but Id argue hes best ... equipped - again with the puns I know) ... unfortunately Id say he is ... programmed to fail! Ok Ill stop but I just couldnt help myself.So if you want to just shut off and enjoy some action on your screen you could do worse. But I hear many already saying ""why a 7? Why rate it so high?"". Well the answer to that is that I was entertained and not bothered too much by the flaws the movie. I understand if you feel otherwise. This is far removed from a masterpiece ...",7.0,1435
adammcgowan-03841, Enjoyed that!,I dont understand the really negative comments on this. Just finished it and was a decent action flick with a good story line.The acting was fairly good with Mackey leading. Never a poor movie from this one and he doesnt let down here.As for the action but not a sci-fi movie.... erm.... I appreciate were close to war machines but unless you all know more than me they dont exist yet therefore this is sci-fi. Felt like the Boston Dynamic robots on steroids though and prob be here soon!If youre looking for a decent action movie dont be put off by the bad reviews. Its definite 7 for me! Enjoy!,7.0,1436

getphysicallyfit, Give it a watch and rate for yourself.,Everyone wants to be Ebert and Siskel clearly. I stopped reading reviews and watched this just now and i will say the first 20 minutes had me concerned but then it performed very well with the intro of Leo. If I would have listened to all the negative reviews i would have missed out on a good movie.Those that say it was predictable I call BS. Those bashing the performance or plot well to each his or her own . I guess they were expecting an extension of the Terminator. I liked the cast line up and the acting. Was good to see Anthony Mackie up front and center again.You wont have any idea what the endgame is until 3/4 of the way through the movie. The bigger issue it addresses is real-time on both AI and our hubris in thinking that we can control its evolution. It calls to light our humanity and the ills that we do coming back at us. Also the aspect of war from the comfort of home with this generation and its love for video games and how that translates to the removal from the real life consequences of pressing a button thousands of miles away first pulling a trigger with boots on the ground in combat is yet another real-time issue.I would have given it a ten but the ending did fall short of the build up. But thats just how I felt.,9.0,1444
aameruk, Chickened out at the end,Half decent entertaining film until the ending which for a second I thought maybe a brave one and wont be the predictable usual By The Book standard script but unfortunately thats exactly what I got in the end Netflix chickened out.Guess what yet again the American Hero saves the day for America and apparently for the whole world!!I was hoping for the alternative ending where USA gets taught a lesson which is well overdue and they richly deserve.,4.0,1445
akarajovic," Waste of time, and money!",Bad movie. No plot bad script worst acting. I seriously think that Netflix has some kind of blackmail on a-list actors and that they need to make this kind of garbage or something bad will happen to them.,1.0,1446
danielmanson, Actually not bad,I watched this film and thought it was pretty good so I was surprised to see so many negative reviews floating about. Yeah sure its not Oscar winning or anything outstanding but its a typical action film that ticks the boxes for said genre.Its a watchable plot with a pretty decent twist towards the end which was nicely unexpected. The acting was okay as was the camera work etc. But yeah I mean its a pretty bog standard action film with guns explosions and fighting. what more do you want with an action film?The actual machines I thought played a minor part of the film and if like me you arent keen on sci-fi youll be fine. Of course this could reverse and if you like sci-fi you might be disappointed by the lack of it...Negatively I will say that the main character isnt exactly likeable and I wasnt too convinced on his characteristics. One minute hes scared next hes brave then he isnt again. Make up your mind mate.Overall though it aint bad. Its a plot that wont challenge you and if you like action just whack it on and see. It wont blow your socks off but it isnt naff either. I think people have got into the habit of just slating Netflix films for the sake of it.,7.0,1447

The reality of this movie is not far from where we stand today and we dont even realize.

Some of it works like the robot warriors (go Chappie!) but some of it is just pointless.

writeztuff, Futuristic,I may not be much of a tech head but the very concept of a human being acting like an AI robot that is human-like to the point of hiding in plain sight is a tough role to pull off and it worked. Not only that but to see the dynamic between the two of them - the push and pull - was entertaining by itself. It was a good action movie with more philosophical points than average. Maybe there were some points of authenticity that need clarifying but overall it was a great action movie that addressed issues and made one think in a way that most dont bother to get into. And it was nice to see POC in a movie that was about a developed story/characters and not just giving a platform to more Black trauma.,8.0,1473

gpeele8, This is a high B rated action movie,Not a great movie by any means but its better than the extremely negative like / dislike reviews make it out to be. The twists can be seen from a mile away but the mentality of the antagonist at the end is an interesting twist on the typical doomsday AI scenario. In all I felt as though there was just too much crammed into two hours and didnt allow for proper character development and relied on too many cliches to carry the story. This story would have been better told in a two season mini series. I do agree that the mechs and the tech behind them should have had more screen time!,7.0,1475
fgranlun," Predictable, sure, but fun to watch!",The script is bad the storyline is flat - theres one single story arc. But the theme is compelling the acting is better than youd expect and the CGI is actually top-tier quality.

Maybe if Ive read it I would have been more excited about it. I definitely think the filmmakers should have taken more care of the details and the substance and try to surprise us a little more it felt a bit bland at times. I wouldnt say its a miss since its a pretty good effort the cg is on point the acting is so-so+ the sound design/orchestration is forgettable but does not fail at doing its job and the plot seemed coherent. My big + is the depiction of the upcoming robot wars that seemed very realistic well thought and most certainly an accurate preview of our future.,7.0,1485

Really bad ending no plot development just over dramatic action scenes that lead up to nothing.This move has some notable features such as the action scenes the good acting skills from both Damson Idris(DI) and Antony Mackie (AM)however what it lacks is a good plot and story development. The story ages like milk instead of wine!The change of sides from Captain Leo(AM) was not well explained and did not make sense to the story. The ending was even more far fetched us there was no real suspense only an outcome we the audience know was going to happen.The story feels rushed and the characters are not developed well enough.Watch: When there is no other option.,4.0,1486
rharrisstoertz," Fast, fun, and satisfying ... More to it than first meets the eye",So we all want different things in a movie right? Acting directing plot message fear thrills ... I wont say this movie has all of that. It certainly doesnt. I can see from the other ratings that many viewers were dissatisfied. They want every movie to be an all-time classic maybe. The acting is not particularly notable in Outside the Wire but it worked. Anthony Mackie (Captain Leo) does it right ... a believable android and superhero type. Almost a cliche but with some refreshing twists. Damson Idris (Harp) seemed a little flat but it was part of his character ... and I found his character likable. You can identify with this guy when he is stricken by the horrors of war. He turns out to be a great Everyman struggling with impossible choices trying to do the right thing forcing himself to go on when he wants to flee. The resistance leader -- not sure of her name -- was great. Such a contrast from expectations!The whole movie was full of surprises like that. I thought it was going to be a problem all the PC angle and stuff but they managed to hit the right tone. Even the setting lent itself to that. These are not the conventionalized faces of a civilian population struggling to live in a war zone. It is not Vietnam or the Middle East or a South American drug war or Somalia. This is Europe. It brings to mind images of World War 2. It is like Kosovo on steroids. The bad guys are your stereotyped Russians or Russian Ukrainians kind of like what we might think of as Chechens or something. But they do make for excellent bad guys with a few interesting twists. They are slightly more humanized than some movies I have seen. If it aint broke dont fix it.I thought the portrayal of the US military would annoy me to the point where it brought down the whole movie. It was kind of annoying on some levels. Hollywood (and Netflix I guess) love to show the military as a bunch of low brow grunts and it bugs me because I know they are professionals. Leadership is outstanding. So the way they treat this drone pilot is utterly unbelievable ... totally fictionalized and cliched. But I got over that. Just accept it as part of the plot. And they redeem themselves by showing that the US is at least trying to do the right thing. Still I had problems with the portrayal of drone strikes as these things causing massive civilian casualties. Which brings to mind the thing that I found most unbelievable in the movie: those missile explosions are absolutely ridiculous! What are they Hellfires or something? A Hellfire can take out a car in traffic and leave adjacent cars almost drivable. Or are they something bigger? No matter the explosions looked bigger than a 2000 pound bomb. Oh well part of the thrill!This movie will be enjoyed by people who like military tech movies. The Gumps are absolute fun! I might just go back and watch those many robot scenes again. I love the Boston Dynamics feel to it the robot dogs mixing in with the soldiers and all that. Battles between robots with humans caught in the crossfire ... thats worth a rating point right there! And man there are some horrific combat scenes up close and personal! Maybe not totally realistic and yes our protagonist survives things against the odds ... repeatedly ... but still these scenes are well done and thrilling. You may want to wear your combat goggles for this one with all the flying concrete chips and stuff.And saving the best for last Captain Leo. Captain Leo! Holy smokes! I forgot he was an android and the scene where he revealed his true nature was definitely a shocker! I havent seen a robot quite like him in a movie. They took it beyond Terminator. A robot that (maybe?) feels pain emotion and compassion. I never could figure whether delivering vaccines was important to him or just a cover and how real his emotions were. He was definitely your archetype of a complicated character. In the end you can even believe he was tormented despite his tough exterior. I guess that fits the superhero meme. But what a superhero! Harp knows he is getting close by the trail of bodies. The shootout when Captain Leo gets Viktor Koval is utter over the top ridiculous pandemonium and fun as hell. Later when you see that he really is mortal you can appreciate what he did there. Here are the real spoilers: was he really a Frankenstein monster trying to destroy his maker because he knew the dangers of his kind? See thats pretty intense. They did it well. And allowing his destroyer (Harp) to survive instead of killing him like he kills everyone else is the classic thing we have seen countless times but I embrace this particular trope. I like to see how different movies do it. It reminds me of the Colonel in Apocalypse Now setting up his own sacrifice. And what an end!This movie is fast fun and satisfying. I didnt think I would rate it this highly until the end and I didnt think I would watch it again until now thinking back on it. I probably will.,9.0,1487
lewilewis1997, I Wanted The 'Bad Guy' To Win...,If this had been made 30 years ago it would have blown people away fact.The ethical questions raised about the use of automated warfare are pretty relevant at the moment as several world powers race to produce robot armies air forces and naval power. Not to cut casualties but to make the fighting more efficient. Who doesnt want a robot that never sleeps and kills without hesitation?The ultimate goal of The Bad Guy is to make humanity question its use of robots in war and maybe not do it anymore? But of course the humans win how could they not? This is a film made by humans.Liberally dosed with some outstanding shootee action many life or death situations and several twists to keep you guessing this was like an ethics lecture performed via a PS4 session playing Modern Warfare.Highly recommended for anyone with a brain or love of action films. Arms designers and generals should be prevented from watching this theyll only get bad ideas.,8.0,1488

petuniaorr, NOT YOU STANDARD ACTION HERO,Bottom line up front: the brains not the muscle wins in the movie. It overall has great action great plot and was entertaining. Is it realistic? Of course not; it has a Cyborg and machine Soldiers for Christ sake.Manage your expectations going in. If you want to see a good movie then you will enjoy this; but if you go in trying to compare this to other action movies from the last 10 years you might be disappointed. Why the plot is not stupid and predictable...someone actually thought this movie through.I will agree with one review which stated the ending fell short. In my opinion thats when the movie decided to go with a standard action movie script. Nonetheless let your imagination and third eye and ear take the lead and enjoy!!,9.0,1496

asage19, Pretty good,Good acting production values - its a well-made movie!Lots of interesting things to ponder.I really was rooting for the AI unfortunately. The young guys character was I guess supposed to be holier-than-thou and naive sometimes pretty darned annoying. I feel that he reaches the wrong conclusion. I am not a war-monger or anti-anything - I feel that the AIs desire could be somehow achieved not so much the kids. How it might be achieved other than what the AI was attempting would be the subject for future movies :)Heres something though - it wasnt until I was thinking about the movie afterward that I realized that they made a movie where the two main characters are portrayed by black actors - I hadnt thought it noticed it - Hollywood is moving along at last.,8.0,1501

djklymaxx-05604," Good Film, Watch It & Ignore the Negative Reviews",I dont know why theres so much negative Reviews. The film was very entertaining straight through. The whole concept was great imo. It had me from engaged from beginning to end and the actors did a great job. You have war films and you have films about AI but I think this may be the closest or the most you are going to get when you marry a good modern war film mixed with futuristic technology (AI) without it coming off as cheesy or ridiculous. It is very realistic in a sense when you consider Tech & Warfare. With the heightened concern about the tensions between the modern day superpowers of the world (US and Russia) the groups that try to resist their ideologies over the many years and how it affects those that innocently live or try to survive in between their influences or advancements; this film touches a nerve. Plenty of action its rugged and many can relate in some way about its philosophy because we all have that What if..?feeling in the back of our minds and I think this film delivers a good plausible answer to the main question.,9.0,1503

stevegill-44313, Entertaining with one huge flaw,I worked in the US Air Force at Intercontinental ballistic missile sites. All underground ICBM sites both Russian and American are hardened against nuclear attack. The drone strike wouldve been totally ineffective. The only possible way It couldve succeeded was putting a missile down the silo hole while the door was open. Sort of like a Star Wars shot. Hollywood often ignores these type of details so that they can create a good story based on a totally in accurate portrayal of some major system. That said I enjoy the movie but that certainly did take away from it. That was not the only technical issue but it was so glaring thats all Im going to mention.,7.0,1515

rachellesuzanne, REAL sci-fi - Creative and exhilarating,My recommendation: avoid spoilers like the plague and dont even read many reviews. This film is best experienced as a wild ride.I simply love how creative it was. Excellent filmmaking required to make a movie set 99% of the time in a cryogenic chamber riveting and suspenseful though a huge amount of the credit for that goes to the lead actress. Ive never seen her in anything before but she was simply phenomenal. Without her this could have gone a different way but if nothing else watch it for her performance.This is what sci-fi is meant to be: exploring how our current and future technologies affect the human condition. The details of the science itself are certainly fascinating but what it gets right is showing what that means for humanity as a whole AND the individual and what it means for our future. I see that lacking in a lot of sci-fi and so its always refreshing to see.I can understand where some of the negative reviews are coming from but in my (naturally subjective) opinion they simply dont outweigh the good and in many cases are wrong. If you love true sci-fi give it a chance. I doubt youll be disappointed in the lead actresss performance and it will make up for any doubts you may have on the rest of it.,7.0,1520
pranayjalvi, Kept on hook,Oxygen was a decent movie not great. Melanie Laurent was amazing and so was the effects and the cinematography.

m_from_space," Pretty to look at, but nothing interesting being told",I just got my first vaccination and felt sickly afterwards so I decided to watch a movie that wont be too demanding for my brain cells. I didnt expect much and that was delivered great choice on my part.Besides being visually impressive and containing a great actress the movie wont give you much. It will end and you will raise one of your eyebrows or chuckle a little bit or even feel annoyed afterwards.Many things were kind of expected in this movie but I dont blame the authors I just watched a lot of stuff and you know how it goes.But now really people have to help me out:So there is this virus that will kill all humans within 2 generations on earth. And we have a technology to build human clones and put all the original memories inside of them. Why on earth would you need to colonize a new planet then? You could just build a secure place on earth with lots of clones that will wake up after say 50 years of human extinction and live on the amazing planet that is still available while the virus will be dead since all humans are dead (herd immunity also works when no hosts are alive anymore). Not only is that much easier but will also have a higher chance of success.So well I dont feel much better but some time has passed.,5.0,1524
ABCloverLane," Tight, inventive script and a superb Melanie Laurent",Oxygen might be Alexandre Ajas best movie to date.Its a one man show or in this case a one woman show as Melanie Laurent delivers a performance worthy of praise as an amnesiac who awakens in a cryopod and tries to figure out how she got there and how she can escape with the help of the AI assisstant MILO. The movies plot is reminiscent of Buried starring Ryan Reynolds only this time were dealing with a high-concept idea that cannot be mentioned without spoiling the movie.What I liked the most about this movie is that throughout its entire runtime it never once loses steam and is able to hold the attention of the viewer. Although its set almost entirely in one location the script always finds ingenious elements to keep the plot going and oftentimes it reaches that nail-biting tension the viewers expect from a sci-fi thriller like this.Melanie Laurent is entirely up to task and she carries this movie effortlessly. Her characters discoveries about her past present and future offer moments that showcase her immense talent of making us care for a character that we like the character itself know nothing about.The direction from Alexandre Aja is never boring and he uses smart camera tricks to maintain tension and suspense. Theres always a sense of engagement with the plot that Aja crafts masterfully although some plot reveals are a little bit convenient and they come exactly when you expect them to.Overall I thought Oxygen benefits from an inventive and well-written script Ajas tight direction and of course Melanie Laurents performance who carries the entire movie on her shoulders.,7.0,1525

MTonyS, Pure nonsesnse,What irritates me most in science fiction films is the ignorance of screenwriters and directors in the scientific aspect. They misrepresent normal logic and science itself to wrap the viewer and in the end show that nothing was clever and they were just huge holes in the script created just to trap you in the chair thinking it was smart and guaranteeing the audience. But what was intriguing and mysterious became absurd and irritating.SpoilersA cryogenic chamber with artificial gravity for which if the person would sleep?

""Oxygen"" has beautiful set design solid acting and doesnt get boring. Theres always this question ""why is this happening"" and one question leads to next.

mickeythechamp, A movie that feels like it has more going on than it actually has,"I watched this movie because it was new at the time on Netflix and I had to review a current film for my podcast. I therefor went in relatively blind. This review might contain slight spoilers.The movie is about a woman that wakes up in a Futuristic medical pod. She has lost her memory and most uncover who she is and how to save herself before the medical pod runs out of oxygen.This is a Sci-fi mystery movie and it carries both roles only half well. The Sci-fi aspect comes from the fact the main character is stuck in a futuristic medical pod that has a computer installed called M. I. L. O. The computer system is more or less just Seri that can google whatever the main character needs. M. I. L. O as a plot device was really clever implemented. Not only does it give us a character the main character can talk too but the way he works also makes it entirely up to the main character to work out the mystery. When she puts two and two together she now can make a better google search in order to uncover the truth. M. I. L. O can not comment nor help her with solving the puzzle he can only follow orders. This made it so more satisficing when the main character figured something out. Mélanie Laurent is more or less the only character we see and hear from. I think she could carry the role but there were instances where I thought the movie was patted out with her being sad and that sometimes made her preformance fell one-noted. Can we by the way get Mathieu Amalric as a Seri voice? Such a nice and soothing voice!The main problem comes from the location aspect and the mystery aspect of the movie. The location is more or less only the medical pod. Dont get me wrong I love one location movies. I think it can create a great focus on the character we are watching instead of working on establishing worldbuilding. The problem here is that the pod quickly wears of as an interesting location and the main charecter is not interesting enough to carry the movie. You quickly get the layout of the pod and the camera can only do so much to make it interesting. While it creates a sometimes claustrophobic look it also sometimes feel like the pod is giant. There was a very beautiful transitional-shot towards the end just to say the camera crew clearly know what they are doing but dont get a lot to work with.What the movie does les well to me is when it gets towards the middle and end. The start of the movie is the strongest part of it but after a while the movie kinda runs out of tricks and mysteries and I was looking at the timer multiple times to find out how much was left of the movie. The movie tries to make a loot of schocking revelations but they never really hit me as shocking. I quickly moved on from the revelations and even caught myself saying ""So?"" aloud to myself. Some of the set-ups to the mystery also has bad payoffs. You get a clue early on and layer it so you can use it in the puzzle and then when it doesnt really make the puzzle look any better you just ask yourself ""why did I save this piece for so long?"" this is among others in relation to a clue such as Léon is working with helicopter leaves. The payoff to this is just not good.It also have some scary aspects to it and here it does not stick to that genre either. It seems like the movie has multiple identitycrises doing it´s runtime and If it just stuck to one them it would feel more complete. Not a big fan of the ending either. It kinda made the movie seem pointless as well as most of the moral dilemmas presented in the movie.Overall I did not really enjoy my time with this movie it seemed like it did not really know what It wanted to be so it just became everything. It seemed like a movie without purpose or moral and kinda just went by. Even though I found the beginning of the movie strong it simply does not save the rest of the runtime. I really dont know who I should recommend this to at all so I will end this by saying it´s a too long movie with an identity crisis too small scale to call it anything special yet too big for what it´s trying to do. The movie fells like it has a lot of cogs turning but it doesnt.",3.0,1543
petewood-59951, Dull and stupid and padded beyond belief,This movie had maybe 15 minutes of story if that. Idiotic plot contrivances drag it out. Like the 911 operator who thinks shes joking because thats what 911 operators do. Or the A. I. programmed to not answer questions or be helpful in any way. Or the sheer stupidity of basically tying somebody up inside a life pod and then not having a way to open it from the inside. Cant see the point of that except to stretch out the first ten minutes of the film. This is the future and the best solution for somebody trapped inside who needs to escape is to bang on the door and scream. You gotta do better than this Netflix. First Stowaway and now this.

akonaludidi, Engaging performance,Oxygen is a Netflix sci-fi thriller directed by Alexandra Aja.Melanie Laurent carried this one scene one actress movie beautifully. The movie opens with the main character waking up inside a cryogenic pod with no recollection of who she is or how she ended up there. Her only ally is the AI MILO manning the chamber.The first act is mainly Liz (the MC) freaking out trying to remember who she is and how she got into this predicament. The second act is filled with impending gloom as she realises that shes quickly expanding her oxygen supplies yet has no means of escape. These were the most thrilling and engaging aspects of the movie because we experienced the frustration claustrophobia and fear along with Liz. The cinematography does a great job of emphasising this claustrophobic environment as well as capturing the futuristic pod.The let down is in the third act for me I thought it fell a little flat from what was promised.

The ancient greeks had the concept of ""Deus ex-machina"": a mechanical gimmick that came out of nowhere to solve the problems in the narrative of a theater play.

Pairic, Boxed In,Oxygen: A French SciFi movie with a new take on the fear of being buried alive. Instead of waking in a coffin a woman (MÃ©lanie Laurent) comes to in a medical cryogenic chamber. The AI monitoring the unit MILO tells her that she has just two hours of oxygen left but wont unseal the pod. Communication with the outside world is patchy and communication is often cut off. To make matters worse the woman is suffering from memory ls but with flashbacks suspects she has been put in the capsule maliciously. A tale of claustrophobic terror with hopes of rescue rising only to be dashed again. She has to battle not only her own panic but also the other enemy within- the AI which helpfully wishes to sedate or even euthanise her. The tension is maintained but you may solve at least part of the mystery about whats really going on. Nevertheless there are are a few interesting plot twists with good effects and a great performance by Laurent. Directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Christie LeBlanc. On Netflix. 8/10.,8.0,1573
deroxybox, It is a good SF for late night binge,"It is a good solid SF film it keeps you invested in it with its twist and turns.

Main characther can be at times bit annoying with her outburst but other than that solid performance. So if you are a fan of SF or you are a gamer ( reminded me of games like Horizon Zero Dawn) then you should give this one a try...and do use original language read few subtitles from now and then :-)",7.0,1574
Tweekums, Good claustrophobic sci-fi,As this film opens a woman wakes in an airtight medical cryogenic chamber. She has no idea who she is or how she got there... or even where there is. The unit is controlled by an artificial intelligence called MILO; this informs her that due to an unspecified problem she is rapidly running out of oxygen. If she is to survive she will have to recover enough of her memories to learn about the situation she is in... and avoid some of MILOs attempts to make her little remaining time more comfortable.Going into this film Id say the less you know the better; there are some good twists and it is best one learns facts at the same time as our protagonist. The film is apart from a few brief flashbacks set almost entirely within the cramped pod; this gives an impressively claustrophobic feel to proceedings. The more we learn the greater the sense of hopelessness. MÃ©lanie Laurent does a really fine job as our protagonist; you can feel both her anguish fear and occasional optimism as situations change. The inside of the pod is well designed; large enough for some movement but not enough for full movement. Overall a solid film for sci-fi fans who dont demand lots of action.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.,8.0,1575
wentos," quite nice sci-fi, some holes in a story",I must admit I was skeptical when I first read about the movie. But I did watch it with the kids. Was a decent experience. Some scientific details were quite off for our current understanding how certain things work but I guess that is OK.I also had some doubts about rationale of the underlying idea but I guess if one takes it apart then no sci-fi stands the trial. I can understand why some are disappointed. No outrageous cgi and effects were limited but I am tired of movies being carried on effects mostly with a platoon strong group of main characters.As said I enjoyed it. Kids did enjoy that too. The little one was shortly off at the end but I guess that was too much for 10yo.I gave it 7 for good acting and good story. It would be more if not for the holes.The movie is safe for people allergic to woke. Who says you cannot make a strong female character w/o abusing our intelligence.,7.0,1576

kimbrys, Attendez la crÃ¨me,"Patience as Hans Landa suggests. Its easy to get carried away with criticism when watching a low-budget movie especially Sci-Fi when your expectations have been raised with the likes of (Insert your favorite high-budget Sci-Fi movie).The story (and acting) did all the heavy lifting. This movie does a great job in conveying the claustrophobic experience Melanies character has to go through with the countdown to death keeping the suspense. Plot keeps you guessing with each twist and makes the audience imagine what they would go through in each step. Granted some decisions can seem far-fetched irratic but given the conditions and the origins of the main character it should be enough to forgive its flaws.This movie gave me ""Moon (2009)"" vibes eliciting a virtual simulation of an emotional ride I would have if I was in the protagonist shoes (pod).",8.0,1578

info-650-994633, Ran out of oxygen,"Wait till the end someone wrote about this ""movie"" which means theres a plot in there somewhere but the whole movie is basically one long wait for it. Unfortunately 50 minutes of oxygen was all I could muster for this story. ""Movie"" is also a term I wouldnt use for it since literally nothing moves really: No character development minimal plotline and very restricted body movement from the main character. It felt like one of those long jokes you have to sit through simply to see if the punchline is worth the wait. That just annoys me but thats personal of course. During ""oxygene"" came this breaking point for me where regardless the brilliance of the plot it wouldnt justify me having to go through another minute of boredom basically. I just didnt care. The challenge for the producers obviously was to deliberately minimize space and character and still get the audience hooked but they failed for me.

Lets start with annoyingly stupid main character who supposed to be somewhat inteligent person with a degree and i dont mean knowlage just some f logic thinking.Second part is that the movie was badly phased  i wont go into detail not to spoil*the fun*And by the rule of three I declare that movie was boring and infuriating. From the first scene i knew how the thing will turn out and a pitiful try to add some thread that didnt fit the genre by making stupid repetitive flashbacks so even a monkey would get every information needed to solve all the problems way before the main lead.

mattmoses-09929, I loved this better when it was called Buried,The writers of this movie clearly watched Buried with Ryan Reynolds. Character wakes up in a confined space desperately trying to figure out where they are how they got there and how to escape. Whereas Buried was an intense experience Oxygen is a bland mess that drags out forty minutes of remaining air to nearly two hours and gives the tacked on happy ending.

MahnoorKhan-FilmCritic, Go For It Guy's...!,Oxygen is a 2021 science fiction thriller film directed and produced by Alexandre Aja starring Mélanie Laurent as Elizabeth Hansen.Its one of the best sci-fi movies of Netflix. I love the creativity of this movie. A movie explaining the scientific concepts our future and current technology & the effect of that technology on the human condition with details.99% of filmmaking is done in the cryogenic chamber with tension suspense and emotions.The movie is shooted in only one location with one character of Melanie Laurent & she played her character brilliantly. She deserves an Oscar for her performance.What I love about this movie is the uncertainty of where the movie is going. Where is the pod? Who is she? Will she get out?

tamojit12, Nice Movie.,A young woman awakens in an airtight medical cryogenic unit and discovers that she is trapped and that the units oxygen levels are falling rapidly. Suffering from memory loss she does not remember who she is or how she got there. She is assisted by an advanced A. I. named MILO but it refuses to open the cryo unit without an administrator code. Using MILO she is able to transmit outside the pod and contact emergency services. She provides them with the cryo units model and serial number which are printed on the interior. Upon contacting the manufacturer they are told the unit was destroyed three years prior. Unable to recall her memories she looks for clues about her past by searching for pictures and articles through the AI computer and finds her name Elizabeth Hansen. She realizes she is a cryogenic doctor. She finds her husband Léo Ferguson and his contact number by accessing her social media but when she calls his number a woman answers. She tells the woman that she is Léos wife and demands to speak to him. The woman seems confused and hangs up.As the oxygen level continues to fall she begins hallucinating and tries to open the pod only to be electrocuted. She then receives a call back from the police but suspects they are hiding something from her and disconnects. The unknown woman she called earlier rings and tells her that her husband is dead. She also gives her the administrator code to open the pod but tells her she cannot open the pod or she will die. Elizabeth uses the code and begins floating without gravity. After a brief explanation it is revealed that she has been placed into hyper-sleep for a 14 light-year journey to another planet. Her secret mission is to travel to a new planet as mankind will be extinct in the near future due to a deadly virus. The virus also killed her husband Léo.Heartbroken by the truth she deduces the awakening was due to a processor overheating and realizes she must divert the functions of the processor to another processor assigned to non-essential functions but initially fails since the data exceeds capacity. As time passes by and with oxygen levels fading she prepares for suicide by attempting to open the pod. Shortly after she discovers Léo is also in hypersleep in the damaged spaceship together with nearly 10000 others but she notices he lacks a scar on his forehead that he had before. Upon further investigation through a video presented by an elderly version of her it is revealed that she is a genetic clone with the original Elizabeth Hansens personality and memories implanted including memories of Léo. The woman she has been speaking to on earth is the original and now elderly Elizabeth Hansen.MILO activates a euthanasia protocol due to a non-existence chance of survival however Elizabeths clone manages to deactivate it and successfully diverts the functions of the processor and is put back in hypersleep. The final scene shows the clones of Léo and Elizabeth on the new planet smiling embracing each other.,9.0,1600

JoelAlexanderr, Highly underrated confined thriller with talent all across the board,"OXYGEN exceeds all expectations of what a confined thriller can be. Mélanie Laurent plays a woman who is trapped in a cryogenic chamber and cannot remember how she got there or who she is. At first it seems like typical pandemic movie that showcases Laurents incredible acting chops but as the film progresses and more is revealed the film ends up being far more intricate than it lets on. Laurent is incredible throughout this film and carries the narrative effortlessly despite being the only character we see (for the most part). Director Alexandre Aja also brings a lot to a little making a movie that is shot in one location feel grand in scale through amazing visual effects and enthralling storytelling. Another highlight is the score by Robin Coudert which builds suspense like a horror movie at times and then transitions to a grandiose build that feels like a science fiction epic a la Blade Runner.This film is one of the biggest surprises of this year so far and might be one of my favorite ""pandemic"" movies yet. Aja proves that with creativity and talent that he can make a tight thriller feel like a major blockbuster which has been missing from many other attempts over the past year. I highly recommend checking this one out on Netflix -- its one of my favorites of the past few months. A.",9.0,1605

ObsessiveCinemaDisorder, An engaging functional sci-fi trapped room thriller,Oxygen the new trapped room sci-fi thriller on Netflix does a decent enough job playing with its claustrophobic premise to entertain the audience.

With no memory of who she was or how she got there and using the online A. I.

When the final reveal came I wasnt as surprised as I should have been from my knowledge of genre conventions and there could have been more red herrings emplaced to make me doubt what was going on.The film is directed by Alexander Aja who directed one of my favorite films from 2019 the alligator thriller Crawl. That was a movie that viscerally places the audience into its horror scenario and they can imagine it happening to them in that real world setting. I actually felt more trapped in Crawl than in Oxygen. The sci-fi setting here kills all the tension.Oxygen while entertaining as a one-time watch feels like a step back for Aja. Oxygen plays like a student film with a professional budget like a first-time director showcasing what they could do if they were given more money. But I know already. I have seen Crawl.Ultimately I wanted more from Oxygen whether that means more playing around with genre expectations plot twists or a personal statement.,7.0,1615

byebenjamin, A small start explodes into a big ending,"Alexandre is back again now with a thrilling french sci-fi flick which feels both fresh and exiting. Mèlaine Laurent brings an excelent portrayl to how anybody would have felt in her situation. She also manages to keep the audience hooked when she is locked down in a box for the whole movie. In my eyes is that pretty damn impressive. The cinematogrophy feels fresh the editing is good and the overall set design and CGI is very well done.Overall Oxygene deliver a new and stylish sci fi thriller wich blends ""burried"" and ""gravity"" into one. With some strong yet somewhat cliche writing this is a movie worth watching.",8.0,1619

personalaccount-30577, To enjoy this you NEED atmos/surround,"While Mélanie Laurents performance was exceptional you need to have at the very least a 5.1 speaker system or else this movie will be nowhere near as good as it is with surround sound. To be honest Id say that if I had watched it with the stereo speakers from my tv id have stopped watching after 20-30 minutes.However that doesnt mean the movie is all about audio -indeed the plot contains interesting revelations- but sound is key here and is very well intertwined the image so it is a major component of the movie (as opposed to marvel atmos movies for eg) and since its a ""no exit"" movie (it all happens in one tiny closed space) the picture alone might become boring if no surround sound is there to accompany it (in reality the picture is what accompanies the audio).Now if youve got any 5.1 sound bar or better the movie is great but its not for everyone indeed being a no exit movie entails that fans of movies like the Avengers and other Marvel movies wont enjoy this as it might feel dull but its only because the sound here is what engages the viewer and creates a true immersion.",9.0,1622

averylubocki, The Best Sci Fi Film I've Seen In Years,"Judging by the IMDb score I probably enjoyed this movie a lot more than most. But with that being said I thought ""Oxygen"" was fantastic. The whole film rests on the shoulders of MÃ©lanie Laurents performance and she knocks it out of the park. I really sympathized with her and I wanted to see her make it out ok. The story was fascinating and lead to some twists and reveals that left my jaw on the floor. This is the best looking movie I have seen from Alexandre Aja so far and I really hope he keeps making movies like this. Let me put it this way if a movie about a woman trapped in a space coffin for an hour and forty minutes can keep my attention thats an achievement by itself. But ""Oxygen"" is so much more. The story the script the characters the cinematography the production design the music. All of it in my opinion was mesmerizing. I highly recommend this movie to those who are looking to get a good fix of sci fi and also those who are looking for a good mystery. Highly recommend!",9.0,1624

And they actually think they ended it well by putting a microscopic sample of our population on some faraway planet with extremely uncertain environmental conditions where those few will probably die off rather than have any chance at re-conceiving(!) and rebuilding any semblance of civilization.This Western doomer-sci-fi trend needs to stop.

This movie stands out by far from all the other movies that also offer you a single setting spot. This movie sort of engulfs you into the fictional world and puts you into the characters shoes that treats you some stress and self-preservation from non-existent harm.I was literally holding my head during some scenes and my heart kept pounding. With that said the directors made a good job and definitely did something unique to make it as good as it is.The only reason I am giving it a 9 is because the area of filming was limited. Other than that the movie is well executed and Im definitely recommending it to anyone that wants a heart-gripping experience.,9.0,1632
jasha89, Predictable,"I liked the production value and I think Melanie Laurent did a fairly solid job in her ""one woman"" show. However the key ""twist"" of the story was obvious to me in the first 10 minutes making it insufferable to get to that revelation after 60+ minutes. Liz the protagonist was constantly unable to ask the right questions which in a story like this one is the only thing keeping it afloat. When the audience thinks faster and is two steps ahead of the lead it is just unbearable.So predictable its unfortunately a dissapointment.",4.0,1633
himmelsvid, A potential masterpiece ruined by director's insecurity,Apart from some logical mistakes it could have actually been a modern sci-fi classic. Intense and beautiful with many classical sci-fi elements. And very unusual for a sci-finto be french! Although the last 10 seconds literally made the rating drop from 9 to 7. In one sense i actually even think those last 10 seconds pretty much destroyed the movie entirely so maybe to be fair it shouldve gotten max 5. But everything up to the last seconds was superb so I cant help myself to give it 7. Anyway a perfect example of a unexperienced director that is so unsecure so that he/she feels the need to state something which is already obvious and already communicated but in the cheeziest most Hollywood B-movie way imaginable.,7.0,1634

But I was at the edge of my seat the entire movie and I never knew what would happen. The twists in the plot were great and its really sci-fi in the sense of that it makes you rethink everything how would I react if x happened to me and what humanity is capable of and whats ethic and not. It was sort of like a black mirror episode because its just about what technology can create and what makes us US?

The writing of the film is very well constructed and despite all the complexity of the story everything is coherent - a quasi monologue which succeed into keeping the spectator in suspense until the end.

Its brilliant how everything develops little by little and how the protagonist takes care of it. I dont have a clear criticism. Instead lots of praise! 10 points for the leading actress!,9.0,1646
Sankari_Suomi, A miasmic ebb & flow of confluent possibilities,Alexandre Aja and Grégory Levasseur. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot actually but somehow we ended up with a winner.First conceived as a Christie LeBlanc screenplay in 2017 Oxygène struggled through years of production hell. The original decision to cast Anne Hathaway in the lead role was quickly recognised as a mistake and she was soon replaced by Noomi Rapace. Franck Khalfoun came on board to direct with Aja producing.But by 2020 it was all falling apart. Aja kicked Khalfoun out of the directors chair and seized it for himself while Rapace was dismissed over concerns about ideological syncretism.Following a discussion with investors that Aja later described as passionate but not entirely unreasonable with intermittent screams Mélanie Laurent was chosen as the new lead.Oxygène wont win any awards for innovation and leans a trifle too heavily on its meagre cast of just three(!) credited characters but its heart is in the right place and its cinematography implies the budget of a much bigger film than it actually is.Mathieu Amalric is the clear audience favourite with his cool and calming Parisian tones. Malik Zidi does what he usually does and does it tolerably well. But it is Laurent who really steals the show as she grapples with the dilemmas of a late middle aged existential crisis.It was Foucault who said People know what they do; frequently they know why they do what they do; but what they dont know is what what they do does. Oxygène takes this wisdom and toys with it teasing out the conceptual strands for a gentler more compassionate examination.Aja and Levasseur are intent on answering the questions we almost never dare to ask: questions about life memory dreams and the philosophy of loveplay. The conceptual framework here is reminiscent of Brecht and Eisler but with a distinctly Büchnerian flavour. Its an aggressively bold experiment and I revelled in the audacity of it all.I rate Oxygène at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale which works out as a perky 7/10 on IMDB.,7.0,1647

At that point things start to get kind of interesting but then the ending is extremely rushed. Its okay (Ive seen way worse) but it would have been better if the first hour was cut and they focused more on how they got from the middle of the movie to the end of the movie. There is a huge gap that I imagine they cut for time. Overall not good but not terrible.,5.0,1649

clanhellekson, OXYGEN- MY THOUGHTS,"Cheerio from my local.I like Alexander Aja. I like he how attempts different genres in each new release; Haute Tension (brilliant) to The 9th Life of Louis Drax (not my thing) he mixes it up. Here hes giving Science Fiction a go - and the result is uneven.We learn Earth has a real deadly virus (not an overblown one for a change) all humans will be extinct in two generations. Solution? Make clones put them on a massive space ship and send them light-years into the abyss to populate a planet thats barely inhabitable...they have to life in the portion that is neither daytime nor night they must rebuild in the area that is permanently dusk. Its a pointless detail. Earthlings in this story are advanced the universe is big why not keep it simple and have relocate to normal planet.Despite our intellectual abilities were still not smart enough to avoid a collision with a named/identified Asteroid/MacGuffin that destroys a good chunk of our plucky space ship but able to continue on. The space rock isnt important...its only needed for the plot.From my vast knowledge of space travel we should have shields or something. Also a Stargate would be helpful. Oh well...perhaps the Asgard will lend an assist. Thor? Anybody?Anyway a cloned woman accidently wakes up from ""hyper-sleep"" and instead of getting up and enjoying a mini-vacation in space like Hollywoods Pratt/Lawrence did in the silly Passengers she is trapped in her pod without any knowledge of what happened. She initially doesnt know shes a clone; possess only fragments of her memory left over from the super brilliant Strong Women that she was made from.Like all ""hyper-sleep"" pods this one is equipped with a talking computer who informs her that oxygen is running out thanks HAL I mean MILO. The helpful and homicidal pod also keeps trying to inject her with a death serum - I have to admit; the automated injector arm was amusingly quick - darting around her attempts to grab it. It made no sense but its entertaining and a nice touch to add some action to an essentially one-location cramped set.Theres always a timer isnt there? Its a nifty way to create tension. Simple set-up and fairly entertaining first act. The problems arise once we find out more about her predicament and the subsequent collapse of logic.With the help of the talking computer she is able to make a phone call home. As shes chatting shes told that the connection is getting weak and they will soon lose the ability to communicate. Hokey dokey...we also learn later on that shes been in the pod 12 years - moreover shes never been out of the pod...bummer for her convenient for the plot. I would ask why the pod has so much tech in it when its only purpose is providing medical assistance to include euthanasia until they reach their destination?Once the film was over I gave it some thought. There are moments of entertainment here great camera work given the environment. A solid attempt to dole out the mystery slowly. A reasonable acting job by the main clone. As a homeowner with a lot of Maple Trees I did appreciate the artistic design of the pods...deploy and let them ""helicopter"" to the surface.So much was left unanswered. Such as supplies needed...did we clone any animals plants food shelter? I like cats so any cat clones on the planet? Who knows?Aja ended up telling the wrong story. He made the universe outside of his main storyline much more interesting. Ultimately the plight of one hapless clone wasnt important. Her death or success wasnt important. It was just one small occurrence wrapped in a much larger story.With all that its still worth watching and if youre an Aja fan as I am its worth your time...but its not better than a 5 star in my view.",5.0,1651

Well played great script awesome cinematography great lighting nice plot (although I was expecting a somewhat darker ending). Its one of those movies they simply cant seem to produce in Hollywood meaning this movie doesnt need the endless explosions sex-scenes people shooting each other and flying cars colliding in the air that a typical Hollywood movie always has to offer as its main attraction. Oxygen has the intelligence that most Hollywood produced movies just seem to be lacking. Also explains the somewhat lower rating as it probably doesnt meet the low expectations of the typical US based viewer. Guess too many people out there are so used watching nothing but endless repeating garbage. Ah well youre never too old to learn.

Lostounet," Breathe in, breathe out","""OXYGEN"" directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Christie Leblanc. Available on Netflix.When a woman wakes up in a cryogenic chamber with no memory shell struggle to escape as the oxygen in her capsule begins to become critical. Her only means of communication is an onboard computer named MILO with which she must discover who she is why she is there and how to remedy her nightmare before time runs out.The French director leaves the piranhas (Piranha 3D) and killer crocodiles (Crawl) to finally sign a high-concept thriller shot in claustrophobic atmosphere with a wonderful Melanie Laurent. The generous and involved French actress takes up the challenge with amazing interpretation. With her face and voice as her only means of expression Laurent runs the gamut of emotions from fear to anger to grief. She simply gives one of the best performances in an exercise where she was not particularly expected.While claustrophobes will start to feel dizzy the narrative finally gets out of this ""jail"" and allows us to escape and discover her memories at the same time as the heroine does. The flashbacks in the hospitals with masked patients and doctors make the tension rise even more strongly on these particular days of COVID.Nevertheless the film dont fall into weird conspiracy and remains on track avoiding even any resemblance with the thriller Buried except for their concept of confinement. The script never ceases to surprise with its rich concept of thematic and narrative twists and turns and feeds the curiosity of the viewer who constantly wonders about the resolution.Alexandre Aja directs a thriller in a confined environment of a very different kind but very effective. With current themes of isolation loss and fear of an uncertain future ""Oxygen"" has never lived up to its name. Thanks to solid direction in an incredibly confined space and the phenomenal work of Melanie Laurent the film becomes a welcome breath of fresh air in todays world.",7.0,1663

ikadery, Thought-provoking and Gripping,Oxygen is a very interesting film. This film never stops taking turns making it very difficult tot predict whats coming next. From the first scene to the last one revelation of the storyline segued into another so swiftly the credit goes to the director for managing to build the film so craftily. The audience will hardly be able to digress from the film it is quite enthralling.The film started off steadily kept the audience almost in the dark until the middle of the film. Then in the midway after revealing some strings of the plot some might think they know where this is going though it still made many swift unpredictable turns but still by midway you would start to care about the character and keep on going. This is not a dumb movie it grazed many ethical scientific issues which are already in motion or pretty soon the humanity will face which will make you think long after finishing the film.Melanie Laurent did an wonderful job her performance was pivotal for the films success.,8.0,1671
freudable, A Sci-Fi thriller who manages to deliver even if self-contained,MILD SPOILERSI just finished this movie and I love it! At first its unassuming on what is happening on the first half. She suddenly woke up from a deep slumber while medical devices are attached to her body. She doesnt remember who she is nor why she is trapped inside a cryochamber. Her only companion to whom she could talk to is an A. I. called MILO. MILO informed her that the oxygen reserves in her pod are only at 35% and she may die of asphyxiation she doesnt do anything about it. From here she decided to do some investigations on her own to find out everything she needs to know about who she was where she is why shes trapped in the cryochamber and how she can survive by using MILO to aid in her investigation. I enjoyed the second half of the movie when the first major plot twist was revealed (there are two) I especially liked her conversation with the female doctor who revealed to her where she is and what happened (first plot twist) and her finding out who the doctor was (second plot twist).8/10.,8.0,1672

kemal-44877," A good movie, but merely okay story telling",I liked this movie. It is always a good thing when one location movies can keep the audience hooked and this one does so successfully. Flashbacks give the much needed breathing room and present the backstory hence story-wise they work well.However the way story was told is very ineffective. Knives Out is a good mystery Looper has good mystery elements. Lost is a cool and mind-boggling production. Oxygen as a whole on the other hand at times is boring and in other times predictable if not pointless. Take for example the fact that she was a clone. Now ask yourself so what? So what if shes a clone? What would change if she wasnt? Can you see the moral dilemma that answers to these questions may present? Thats 24K gold right there and yet the story never actualizes that potential as well as many others. Simply put character work is too thin to make this movie deserve any score that is higher than a 3 on my IMDb list but this doesnt mean that its a bad movie. I certainly enjoyed my time. A touch of suspense would certainly help elevate the quality of the work.The ideas presented in the story and the concept is cool. Dont skip to check this one out!,3.0,1679

buttyfrench," In space, they cannot here your scream except when on an intercom of some type",I dig alot of space movies and movies with hot women doing hot things with they bodies. This is one of those movies! The girl in the movie is a space vixen if you know what I am saying. The ship is a talking spaceship and he can help the girl and many many people. The space war is just OK. No lite saber fights at all. But you do have the biggest space battle ever filmed with lazers and atomic weapons. This is a movie where you think that you know that the person in the movie know what everyone outside the movie knows but it is NOT the case. In 1977 something like this happened on earth and they was not anyone left to tell about it so this movie can tell the story for that when it did happen. If there are 10 people that say something is good and just one that says that it is GREAT then I am that guy! Please see this movie and wtach it with friends because it will scare all of you to the bone. The sex scenes were very graphic and with tons of sweat.,10.0,1683

Everything else makes me just wonder ""why""? Logic behind Lizs action is dubious. Technology makes my eyes roll. Holograms yet still cant do anything better than 1st iteration of faulty google AI that cant even answer basic questions ""cause reasons""? Hundreds of buttons screens panels... But they are useless? A capsule that requires a code to open... FROM INSIDE?! Whole room flashes angrily red while it malfunctions? That sure as hell will be usefull for confused occupant of said capsule yeah lets just make him even more confused while he cant see panels nor anything. Smart. A static noise while calling via net? Really? A policefolks still operating like its early 1900s? No.. actually thats correct.Main character Liz a scientist acts like headless highly emotional chicken with extreme glimpses of inspiration suddenly asking extremaly relevant questions... just to act like a goof right after untill next flash of wisdom. Terrible totally pointless and annoying flashbacks. Listen movie whats the point of quick flashbacks here? Other than disrupt the flow of the movie?Overall: she doesnt act like human being. The script makes her too artificial. I do however like (sarcasm) how she undermines her own survival by going into hysteria. Yep nothing fixes your issues as good as turning your brain off to scream while your *insert movies name here* deplates. Smart.If you guys like detective puzzles and try to actively work on solving the mystery or even try to compete with actor with who gets the correct answer first this movie will be nothing more than mudcake to eat through.

If you dont have the money to make it look good dont do it seriously. The film gains nothing from the pan-out spiral graphics.

Bonus points to JT for playing a character so remarkably different than himself. It resonates for people especially from smaller towns or who have dealt with bullying growing up.

Lewis_Heather787, Breakout Performance !,"Now this film was surprising to be fair I wasnt expecting much however Im not sure my lack of expectation had any impact on feelings about the film. I did see the trailer for this a while back and didnt really think anything of it thankfully the film is much better than the trailer.This film for me is the breakout performance from Justin Timberlake. Now for years I have always thought that he only appeared in films due to his fame and that he didnt really have any talent. He would always play the cocky self centred handsome guy. There was no other level to his performances to me anyway they were always the same. I have never taken him seriously whatsoever that is until now. ""Palmer"" is not just a good performance from Timberlake it is a fantastic performance that I feel even deserves award consideration. I know that is a giant leap from being just that famous singer that appears in films to Oscar worthy performances however I feel that its warranted. He is absolutely terrific in the lead role of Palmer it is such an understated performance for the majority. I dont see him ""transforming"" or going deep in ""method"" acting its just an honest and phenomenal performance from start to finish. If this is the level that he can act too why has he waited so long to show everyone. From not liking the guy that much I cant wait to see his next project.Now the story is not as straight forward as you might think there are a ton of story threads in this film. Thankfully all of them get there screen time. The main focus is Palmer getting out of prison and restarting his life. Add the introduction of an ""abandoned"" little boy who lives next door into Palmer and his grandmothers lives. Obviously the most serious topic of the film deals with people being able to accept that Sam the little boy is gay. It is a very difficult topic to get right and sensitive one at that personally I felt the film handled it really well. However there is a section of our society that will hate this film regardless if it handled it well or not......its sad but true. Plus enter Sams drugged up mother and dodgy boyfriend Palmers love interest social services. There is a lot going on in this film however all of it works in harmony all these threads have satisfying conclusions which is rare to see.Id have to also mention the great writing and directing of this film without them both it wouldnt be as affective especially emotionally. In the wrong hands this film could be to confusing or would prioritised some elements of the film more than others.Overall its 70% out 100 its a surprisingly good film and one absolutely incredible performance from Justin Timberlake who I thought was stellar. Now I never thought Id ever say that hahaha. To be honest its great acting overall. Complex relevant interesting heart warming story with some great writing. This film delivers what its selling and then some.",7.0,1711

But no he didnt! And this is precisely what is great about Palmer and about ""Palmer"" the film.

The story was touching and the acting was very good but what brought it was Mr. Timberlake. I would have never have thought he could pull off a roll such as this.

jwvandegronden-1," Amazing... Well written, great acting, and gutwrenchingly honest",I dont know if all the possible realities portrayed are as common or as valid as real life often shows us but within the logic and the narrative of the story all the emotions were so human and so relatable I cried a few times troughout the movie. No emotional blackmail but real human interaction with the ordeal of the characters. That was very powerful.Juno temple really took my breath away with her performance as the mother of Sam. The moment she realizes she has to hand over custody of her own son who she is hurting by being her incomplete self the raw feeling of both courage and a cop-out with all the inner turmoil knowing your kid is going to choose someone else over you and you agree with that... I cant put into words what that does to me as a father if I would be in that circumstance it would kill me it would rip my heart out. And it is such a powerful moment.Not a moment you feel pressured in taking sides on the contrary. I oftentimes felt quartered by my constantly shifting loyalty between the different protagonists in this movie and the struggles they went through. Justin Timberlake is a great actor Ryder Allen is marvelous and does such a great job at being both vulnerable and unwaveringly true to himself and the chemistry between the two is so well captured I can go on and on. There are definitely some classical all American standards that might put you off in any other film but in this it is the string of pearls of real moments and real emotions that hold the movie together and overshadow any shortcomings in the peripheral story lines. Go watch the movie. Well worth the investment mainly the emotional kind.,8.0,1720
vrobello, I'll definitely watch it again !!,Justin Timberlake played such a great role in this film. His facial expressions in my opinion definitely made me feel what he was feeling especially when it came to Sam. Perfect movie for those who cant or I should say wont allow themselves to accept people for who they are. That way of thinking needs to go. That cycle needs to end . Palmer was a little sketched out at first but before one knew it Palmer had a whole new way of seeing as well as accepting it. The little kid who played Sam was amazing !!!

Overall its a warming story and all the actors gave good performances especially Justin Timberlake and the kid who plays Sam.However the story along with Timberlakes character was slightly predictable and this isnt the type of movie that sticks with you that you remember for years to come.While I enjoyed the relationship between the 2 main characters there wasnt actually much drama between them or them having to overcome any obstacles / differences in their own relationship.Timberlakes character is pretty accepting of the boys character straight away which isnt bad but it doesnt provide any drama at all.

akcenat," A one-time stream drama ""Palmer"" is too predictable, being just a nice little feel-good (TV) movie","Without question this is Justin Timberlakes best performance to date yet it wont take a rocket scientist to determine how quickly Palmer (JT) and Sam (Ryder Allen) bond with each other considering theyre both outcasts in a southern town. Also the story stumbles during its third act coupled with the expected return of Sams mother (Juno Temple) to the screen still there is nothing she can do except looking alternatively pathetic and hysterical. It doesnt help that the film trots out so many clichés about the South (and the hardscrabble folks who live there). In the end nothing about this film is downright bad but ""Palmer"" never lives up to what could have elevated the story and J. Timberlakes performance. Also movie does nothing new in its story playing safe rather than bringing something new to the table being just a decent distraction from all the madness with COVID-19 pandemic right now with some lovely moments between Timberlake and Allen that is primed for a reunion in something more deserving of their talents.Rating: 6+ Watchable",6.0,1733

The boy is extremely effeminate and while Justins character at first seems really taken aback by this he quickly grows to encourage and empower the boy. Once this part in the movie comes around you will quickly realize what is going to happen next there isnt any twist or surprises.

So watch and feel good that the world is so embracing (not) and that there is hope for us all to accept (not).Not the worst thing you will see but probably not something youll much remember in a day or so but at least its a break from superhero action and teen flicks that streaming seems to be pumping out showcasing so much of right now. Enjoy a break between the hours of those type of films on the streaming services.",6.0,1741

barcaunited-31224, Provides a telling social lesson,Fine acting by JT and the obviously talented youngster who plays the part of Sam the little boy. Unfortunately proves what we all know the pain caused by parents who make the wrong choices whether its absent fathers or parents who put drugs and crime before giving their children the guidance of a decent upbringing. Says much about the problems in so-called civilsed society today.,5.0,1743
jos-dsouza, Boring... a big yawn,Ok lets be practical. You want to see a movie thats either entertaining or practical. This is neither. They tried to make this like an emotional attachment for a kid but it just ended up as a big yawn. It lacks a genuine feeling. Everything looks forced. You dont connect to most of the emotions. This is now the way things go in life. Highly overdone and highly overrated.,2.0,1744

carnagecarney, Awesome movie,Like a Korean Guardians of the Galaxy. Mind blowing scifi special effects - if this film was in English with a Marvel production logo in the intro everyone would be scoring it 8.5 or 9.I watched the English version which you dont even notice after 10 minutes. This movie was awesome. Awesome effects awesome & very original concept awesome screenplay... Its awesome.If you like SciFi this movie is a real treat. If you dont you will still fall in love with the characters story arc and spell binding special effects !Highly recommend - 8/10,8.0,1750
jade-fire, Down right refreshingly beautiful (spoilers),"Never given a damn review in my life because who cares about one persons opinion these days. But this film? Is entirely worth the watch and the time spent with it. The narritive was refreshing and gave every character motive means and reasoning for their actions and feelings. Begining was soild middle was painful and the ending alittle lack luster in certain parts but the emotional pay off was amazing.Given the setting of the film you freely buy every aspect of it from the different languages and peoples in space. The economy class system and characters a sort of ""Ready player one"" mix match of faces in the supporting case that gave the world building a soild foundation. Decent messaging to the over all story nothing really ground breaking and there are some aspects of the story I personally would have liked to see explored alittle more.Ill leave it with this as someone who loved firefly this film feels like a spiritual nod of respect to what Joss Whedon accomplished with a small budget and a killer cast. The only reason I didnt rate this higher then 8 was due to some jarring cuts in fight scenes and the villain being alittle 2d",8.0,1751
slmcdee, A Solid Ride,Space Sweepers is a pretty solid ride with great CGI especially when you consider the budget was around 21mil (USD). I see a lot of people saying that the acting was subpar for some of the cast and supporting cast but how can you truly gauge it when youre more than like watching it in another language.It met the expections I have for these Netflix Sci Fi films. If you enjoyed Wandering Earth then you will more than likely enjoy this as well.,8.0,1752
eduardvimard, Never had high expectations & I was actually surprised.,In all honesty I dont get the negative reviews...I mean just by seeing the trailer you realize more or less what is all about. In terms of entertainment this movie is cute and so much fun to watch and actually delivers...so people moaning all the time by saying oh is that oh is the other should just enjoy it for what it is.Another good release from South Korea which didnt disappoint.,8.0,1753
wolfzrain, It was fun,This is a Korean version of Serenity.The plot is very similar.But I could enjoy the entire watching.Up-dong (A robot) is funny. Kot-nim(A child) is adorable.Overall its recommended.Fun to watch try it.ps1. the budget was 21 mil $. Could you believe that?,7.0,1754

dannypark247, Not bad at all for their first sci-fi epic,Considering the scale of this movie and what they set out to do Id say this was a success. It was off not perfect and missed often. But overall very entertaining impressive and promising for a whole new film category for South Korea to add to. And they have a lot now. Btw its nice to see a variety of countries and languages represented here not just the usual English only which I find more realistic in a sense. Btw it is very difficult to incorporate so many different languages and it didnt always work out. But I always thought these futuristic space stories had way too many people from only certain countries ie USA and UK. Star Wars are suppose to be aliens not even human far far away and they are still mostly....English speaking white people basically. No one ever thought this was odd? Anyways looking forward to more sci-fi to come out of South Korea and other countries for that matter,7.0,1756
spasek, South Korea is the New Hollywood!,"All Hollywood can do anymore is give us CGI-fest films with no depth in character or story or remakes that are almost all worse than their originals. Typically the films tend to mirror the demands of their audience; people who can barely sit through anything that actually requires some attention.Korea gives us a great space story that is a bit of a mixture of Wall-E Firefly and Blade Runner. The film also gives us a great balance of story character and action. Why does the story work so well? Because like all great storytellers they focus on the story and the characters.George Lucas once stated ""a film with special effects and no story is a pretty boring thing."" Funny how he would actually end up going against his own proverb and it is also true of what has happened with much of western filmmaking as stated above.The film also has a lot of heart which will make the viewer all the more appreciative that it isnt just an action movie. This is enhanced by veteran actors like Joong-Ki Song (Descendants of the Sun) and Tae-Ri Kim (Mr. Sunshine) as well as Jin Seon-Kyu.The movie isnt perfect but if you want a good story some laughs and some great action sequences you wont be disappointed.",8.0,1757
bheadher," Sure it has flaws, but if you stick it out...",...you end up not caring about those flaws.I grew up in the post WW2 influx of Japanese SciFi movies flooding the US so I can appreciate how a foreign film can turn people off after a while...but this South Korean entry into the mix does something that I find intriguing...it grabs your attention with the production values and presentation.. Yes it uses old worn out themes from just about every US flick ever produced but that ends up not being a distraction since the director keeps shifting your focus...This is a multicultural movie using actors from many different nations and it is worth watching I think...oh the CGI is very well done too mixing it up with some decidedly Steam Punk-ish sets too...in other words Space Sweepers is a refreshing departure from the usual foreign fare...,7.0,1758
scientiaetveritas, Great visuals can't conceal the weak plot,Protagonists are very cliche (their background stories & personality traits) so is the antagonist (as often seen: big tech company gone bad its evilness is poorly motivated...). Classic good versus bad story lacking of grey levels. Very typical expected plot & outcome with lots of plot armor on the way. Fans of action & light entertainment will like it sci-fi fans (like me) might still take some pleasure because of visuals & the general setting.,6.0,1759
DeBBss," Technically impressive, but lacks a good story",Space Sweepers is a really impressive film considering its budget of $20 million USD. The CGI and sets are great and it really proves that you can make high quality films for a cheap price. Aside from that Space Sweepers is pretty average. The story doesnt really offer anything new and its pretty cliched. The acting was the worst part about Space Sweepers. The main actors were decent enough but the supporting cast gave underwhelming performances. Lastly Space Sweepers is way too long they couldve cut about 15-30min and it wouldve improved the pacing by a large margin. Overall Space Sweepers is a slightly above average film. The only thing thats holding up this movie are its impressive visuals. Id only recommend this film if youre into sci-fi and space fights but if youre coming for a story then you should give this one a pass.,6.0,1760
naderofficial, What's up with the bad reviews? THIS IS A FREAKING MASTERPIECE.,I swear to god I dont usually post reviews on IMDB but I just had to review this one. Korean movies seem to be stepping up getting even better than some of big Hollywood movies.My brain still not able to process why people cant enjoy anything anymore? Seriously why the bad reviews? Its like some people ran out of dopamine in their brains to feel happy.This movie has it all comedy grief joy mystery excitement suspense its like an all-in-one package which triggers every emotion you have. And the Visual effects were insane! dude I cant believe they only spent 20M$ on this one. It was next level seriously. I wouldnt be surprised if they said 1B$. Not to mention the sounds effects were out of this world also.Please dont waste your time reading the bad reviews. Some people are having a bad day. Go ahead watch it I highly recommend it and trust me you will NOT regret your decision. Its 10 out 10 for me.,10.0,1761
jaylinb," Enjoyable, engaging and fun!",Crumbled across this on Netflix and so glad I chose to watch - starts out with a bang and kept me interested the whole way through. Very well done was originally meant for the big screen but due to COVID came to streaming services. Id happily pay to see this in a theatre.,9.0,1762
vukicevicdora," Entertaining, versatile and unique",This movie has a lovely story characters setting visuals action and a strong message that will make you appreciate our planet with unique new love.Spiced up with cheezy kitsch aspects typical for Korean movies depicted precisely for parts that can forgive such handling it offers a joyful ride seriously awesome action and effects and an emotional thrill.It also plays with a cult of personality and irony sometimes on a trace of good old Starship Troopers from 97 has unique insight in a colonisation of Solar system similar to although not as serious as the masterpiece - The Expanse and it takes out the best from Cowboy Beebop.This is not a sci-fy with internal science-proof story as Stargate for example but it doesnt intend to be bigger than it is. Its refreshing to watch as a honest fun and touching movie.The parts I would like to point out further is great and strong characters without that annoying socio-political corectness and placing something in a movie just to be oh so modern and absolutely amazing blend of all cultures and languages.It evokes feelings of unity togetherness love and it actually has a lot of humour once you get used to the language(s) used. Humor irony and criticizm of society are slided in elegantly almost as Psy makes fun of rich Koreans in Gangam Style.I will now hapily go lie down in my yard and kiss my planet Earth for still sustaining us and then I will attend to my recycling.,10.0,1763
isabellacheng, I so wanna like it more...,"This Korean production clearly rivals Hollywood ones. Many point at Firefly as inspiration but I would say Valerian is also a good comparison. The story is original and has an interesting premise. The CGI and set design are top notch no question about that. The multi-lingual thing isnt too distracting to me as I am watching it with subtitles anyway but that actually resolves ""why everyone speaks English in movies"".The deal-breakers for me are however the screenwriting and editing:Many scenes are unnecessarily long.Instead of ""show dont tell"" they foreshadow it then show it then also exposit it. Say a certain underground fight sequence. It is foreshadowed by a friends visit then with the knife then the person is shown then said person explains everything... Thats too much dont you think?The transition between set pieces is not smooth. Consciously you know they are heading to the next location to progress the plot but the cuts are jarring.The timing of events are also quite bad. Say in a rescue mission the protagonist has the time to leave the ship to do a side quest while the crew is supposed to be leaving immediately and he manages to catch up. The finale is a time-critical mission but there are at least two extra set pieces inserted. Then when they have just broadcasted a message out everyone is already there somehow.The heros realization happens too late and too sudden. But you know its going to happen since early in the movie so the protagonist is being an unnecessary a**h*le throughout most of the movie.Too many plot twists. Some really obvious some really bad. The final one was brilliant and heart-wrenching then they have to ruin that with another plot twist and a plot hole as a byproduct.Too many plot holes. I feel like the writers have some plot milestones to hit but just lazily filled in the sequences in between.Background characters like people watching the news are given close ups. But their acting are so bad/stiff...All in all I like the concept and I am surprised by the quality. But there are jarring holes in the execution that I just couldnt ignore. For storytelling purpose I would say a trilogy or a miniseries are more appropriate formats for this IP.",7.0,1764

luckyg-65765, I enjoyed it alot!,I still cant believe the budget on this movie was only $21.2 million! Thats incredible! I loved everything about the movie from the cast to the storyline including the special effects. Acting was great from the main characters (please turn off the dubbing). Few people are complaining about the CGI but just ignore them theyre spoiled from watching movies with $200+ million budget. I could only imagine what Koreans could do with that kind of money spent. And please dont make comparison to the Expanse Firefly or anything else because its completely different. Only similarities are that its in the future and outer space. If you think this is bad watch the $250 million budget John Carter. A huge letdown! There are others I wont mention.For Koreas first space sci-fi movie I was truly pleasantly surprised how good it was and loved that there were international cast as well.,10.0,1768
Turanic," It's a pass, but nothing more",The films storyline is ok but nothing extraordinary... Although the year is 2092 it looks more like 2192 there is no way there will be such massive orbital structures built by that time... As a sci fi Junkie I can see straight away from where all the ideas were picked.. The whole garbage in space collecting comes from Planetes outlaws idea from Bebop... They also tried to do a robot character like Bender or K2SO but ended up leaning closer to Jar Jar ...Overall the films storyline is probably better than Valyrian but not as entertaining as ridiculous Jupiter Ascending... What most people wont like is pretty cliché characters sometimes annoying behaviour and a lot of soapy moments focused around a a child...,6.0,1769

MRT_, I guess there is a movie hidden inside a lot of space sweeping junk,There is some quality hidden inside this movie although it can probably not be fixed in its entirety.I dig the happy crew vibes of this movie but this movie is sloppy to say the least. The flaws in the story didnt bother me as much as the flaws between the scenes this made it a particular hard watch. One moment a main actor is about to sacrifice itself and then he walks back on the bridge. Enemies and good guys seem to appear out of nowhere to give this movie an overdose of plot turns or set up scenes.You also will get sidetracked a lot into unessisary scenes that are only distracting. A lot of my criticism would be fixable by just releasing a better cut removing distracting scenes that dont progress the storyline and removing scenes that dont tie up loose ends and then its needs to set up the remaining scenes properly with some more dialogue this last item would be a hard fix. This movie is probably a 4.5 and i am giving it a 5 just for the attempt and for the love of sci fi. If they would fix it i guess it has an 6 or 6.5 potential.,5.0,1771

anthonywemyss, A great start ...,No one can dismiss the CGI as being awesome and the set design is very good. Beyond that though the story struggles through a lack of clear direction. Acting is OK with too many folks seemingly dragged off the streets and offered speaking roles. Script needs to tighten up a lot and you could cut 20 mins off and still have a decent movie. It was certainly watchable and I enjoyed it for the most part but I wont be posting it to FB as a must watch.,6.0,1774
bigpaul6-740-221238, Disappointing,Let me begin by stating that I am a fan of Korean cinema. They make superb movies that exist contrary to the stereotypical efforts coming out of Hollywood recently & as such are a breath of fresh air. Space Sweepers however does not deserve the same accolades. To begin with I was put off by erratic behaviour from the characters as they displayed cartoon-like exaggerated responses behaved irrationally at every turn & would suddenly launch into fits of violence for no apparent reason. Really. It was like a bad martial arts film. The dialogue was far too rapid & to be honest I just couldnt keep up with the subtitles. The action sequences were choppy & it was difficult to follow exactly what was supposed to be going on. To make things worse the story was not sufficiently engaging & after about half an hour I gave up. On the plus side though the special effects are stunning,3.0,1775
avicohenk, Awesome!,If this was an American sc-fi with names like George Lucas people would have rated it 9 or above!Its a good movie with awkward Korean vibes but over cool fun and interesting dont dwell over the minor issues. Its a great movie!Better then most American sci-fi lately.,9.0,1776

judicmr, Surprisingly Great!,This is a great fun movie which is what movies are supposed to be. A little long so you may want to plan an intermission.

Go6565," A children's movie, not a SF epic",Here is one thing I wish other reviews had mentioned: its a childrens movie (OK the English title is a clue but Id assumed that was just an awkward piece of translation from Korean). Its spectacular and all that but I challenge anyone over the age of nine to put up with these characters situations and dialogues for two and a quarter hours without drifting off. If you are above that age this functions best as background while you are working doing homework or playing a videogame: it really wont require any of your attention and the loud noises will warn you whenever there is something on screen worth watching.,5.0,1779
fgcity, The movie is a mess,It seems that despite the cool graphics sets and budget the editor or director just slapped the cuts together while being drunk and called it a day. I dont understand who let this get published as it is. If they just spent a fraction of all the money and time on piecing the story properly it could have been a great movie. The plot cuts and trips as the timeline progresses you have to pretty much guess half of the story as you go. Many key scenes and explanations are missing. I would say that a Tom & Jerry cartoon has a more comprehensive story flow than this. Was exhausting to watch and it really is a shame. Whoever edited this should be shot.,2.0,1780
worksmart-58506, Just enjoy it,People need to get over themselves and just enjoy it for what it is. Its visually stunning with a terrific soundtrack and a ton of fun.

eidolonmd-35-890170, An Exhilarating and Refreshing Spacecapade,I just finished this Netflix movie and OMO! Wow. What a game changer for K cinema. As a long-time sci-fi fan this is now easily in my top 10 films of all time in that genre. I love the reimagined Wizard of Oz allegory dynamic plot production quality talented international cast and richness of the elaborate multicultural world and full-bodied characters - amalgams of collective dystopian civilizations and all my favorite elements of some of the best sci-fi movies that have crossed our paths through the decades - Blade Runner Serenity Guardians of the Galaxy The Fifth Element Total Recall and many others. A handful of awkward lines as well as scenes with lukewarm tertiary character acting or mildly disjointed transitions do detract a few decimal points from a perfectly seamless viewing experience but the magnitude and refreshing exhilaration of the entire film still overpower those and make it a must-see. The killjoys over at Rotten Tomatoes seriously need to have more fun in their lives.,9.0,1782

How could this possibly be at about the same level as Mortal Kombat (roll eyes) Godzilla vs Kong (more rolling of eyes) Waterworld (eyes rolled right up) ?!?Story: great!Acting: great!Special effects: great!Hint: In ANY foreign language movie it is generally better to watch the original language and read the subtitles.. dubbed titles almost always lose some of the emotion that goes into the actors portrayal.,10.0,1791

mccutch22, Underwhelming return to the cinema,I was so excited to see this. It was a tradition for me and my buddy back in the day to go to the theater every Halloween for the new Saw sequel. We just had a good time.I had pretty high expectations for Spiral but even as I was lowering them throughout the film I kept being disappointed. The traps just werent impressive at all. Ive heard a lot of people say the first one was amazing and while it was filmed quite well I didnt think it was great either. So many traps that were simpler from the first 4-5 movies had so much more of an impact. Ill skip over discussing a lot of the details of the film and just get to the ending which had major Saw IV vibes and left me feeling pretty empty. Im not one of these people that claims to have seen the twist coming...I didnt but it didnt make my jaw drop or fascinate me at all. The ending felt rushed and I dont know exactly what impact they were trying to have.Im giving it a 5/10 simply for the effort of bringing the series back. Rock does a decent job really. I just wish the creativity was there.,5.0,1797
Chiggychiggy, Entertaining but rushed ending,Now I will say this this is not a bad film for most part I quite enjoyed seeing Chris rock as the more serious detective comparing too his more comedic roles in other films. Now if you enjoyed the first 2 saw films then youll appreciate the film a little bit more since it has more of a story element and as much as this has some interesting traps and still has a lot of blood and gore its not as over the top as the films from saw 3 onwards so it was nice too see it try too go back too its old element of the first 2 films.Now the main problem I had with this film was the ending I wont spoil it for everyone but it did feel very rushed and as much as I was praying that the reveal would throw me off and trick me it was so easy to predict who is the jigsaw copycat midway in the film and was hoping it would be completely different too what I predicted but it just felt rushed. Overall it was a good time watching this at the cinema not perfect but way better then jigsaw that came out a few years back and feels like a homage to the first 2 saw films.,7.0,1798
thefendiprint," Jigsaw says ""ACAB""","I have been a Saw fan since the early days and am always excited when another one is in the works but I have very mixed feelings about this film. On one hand theres a lot to like and also plenty to dislike about the final product. For starters the best parts were obviously the traps and the ending however the film overall feels rather soulless. It doesnt particularly feel like a Saw film though I guess at the same time Spiral is the most similar in structure and atmosphere to the first Saw film. But something still just felt off.Im not particularly a fan of Chris Rock so I wasnt super impressed by his performance per se but it wasnt as bad as I thought it may be. The rest of the cast does their parts fine but nothing to write home about. The story is fine emphasis on fine but I will say that I do like that this killer is basically hunting bad cops which is very politically relevant. But a lot of it still felt very forced and the ending while it makes sense isnt gratifying enough nor does it even really get resolved (now that they have Saw 10 on the way I kind of expected the cliffhanger). Also I absolutely HATE this new voiceover they chose for the killer it sounds AWFUL. Please just go back to the OG voice I beg of you!Now this isnt to say the film is ""bad"" but it surely isnt very memorable. There are elements that work here sure but ultimately the sum of its parts leaves much to be desired. As much as I really wanted to enjoy the film more I would go as far to say this is probably among the worst of the franchise despite it technically being a spin-off(?) of sorts (or at least a departure from the John Kramer story). And maybe thats because the Kramer story was so intricate and intriguing whereas this one is doing more of the same but with a less interesting version of Jigsaw. Hopefully it can be redeemed by the sequel but I wont be holding my breath. The quality of the franchise has gradually decreased with every new movie and its obvious the end times may be near. But with all this said I will always support Saw and any future films because shes an icon after all!",6.0,1799
jimsty1988, Pretty Damn Good for a Saw Sequel,"Its very easy to say that the Saw series jumped the shark a long long time ago. Some may even argue that it began with Saw 2. But its also very easy to say that Spiral is a refreshing new chapter in the gory series of Saw. There is undoubtedly a few head scratching moments in the film that might make you scratch your head and ask ""really?"" but at the end of the day since the disappointing Saw 8 came out 4 years ago I must say -- THIS is the Saw sequel weve been patiently waiting for since the release of the original film in 2004. The story is very intriguing were entertained by great acting (especially from Samuel L. Jackson) and the twist is a little predictable but it still had me at the edge of my seat. All in all I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it!",9.0,1800
jtindahouse, Rock is excellent in a same (but different) entry in the Saw/Spiral franchise,As a huge fan of Chris Rock and a huge fan of the Saw series when I heard that Rock was behind the revamped Spiral movie we were getting I was beyond excited. Then a worldwide pandemic came along delaying the film by 12 months which only served to get my anticipation levels up that little bit higher. The end product is an interesting one. Its better in some ways than I hoped and less so in others than what I hoped.What really took me by surprise the most was how much I liked Rock as the lead. Early on we get a little stand-up routine from him (in context of the movie of course - more or less) and then here and there we get little glimpses of his terrific humour which he has obviously inserted into the script himself. But when its time to get serious he is more than capable. He brings great intensity to the movie and combining that with his natural charisma makes for a great centrepiece of the film.The film takes a little bit of a step-back in terms of the brutality of some of the traps. Make no mistake there are some brutal things to watch in this movie however I suspect a conscious effort was made to reign things in just a little. In previous Saw movies it felt like they were going out of their way to make as many audience members faint as possible. Here is just feels like they are trying to find a good balance between keeping the gore-enthusiasts pleased and keeping those less inclined to enjoy that type of thing in the cinema.The pacing of the film is lightning quick. Theres a little bit of set-up and character introductions early on but once the action begins it never relents. The film is only 93 minutes admittedly however it is over before you know it.Theres a new voice on the tapes this time around. At first it took me off-guard and I didnt quite know what to think of it. However by the end of the film it had grown on me a lot. It is very different to the one we had in the original series. I will be interested to hear what other people thought of it. I can see it being quite a polarising thing.I wont get into the conclusion of the film (always a treat in the Saw/Spiral universe) suffice to say it is quite different to how we are used to these films ending. I still think I need to go back and rewatch the final scene to fully understand certain characters motivations and what they were trying to achieve. The door has been left wide open for more sequels though so if this one is a success then prepare yourself for Spiral 2-8 in the coming years. I say bring them on.,8.0,1801
skylinekiller, B - Movie Writing,This movie had potential but the writing was just awful. If you are looking for a nice plot twist then us best watch the previous ones. Chris Rock made a valiant attempt but fell short...by a long shot...and should stick to standup or comedies. The kills scenes were rather decent but were a little redundant with the design. Overall the movie is hollow and falls right in line with the rest of 2020-2021 movies leaving us hungry for a quality product.,4.0,1802
ebogart-11645, Spiraling down the drain,Im a massive saw fan. Ive seen every saw movie multiple times. This was by far the most disappointing movie in the series. It has nothing that makes saw movies great. None of the traps were any creative really. The punishments for failing the traps werent nearly as brutal as the previous films. The ending was one of the worst twists in the entire series and everyone I saw the movie with called it within the first 20 minutes of the film. There are also countless unanswered questions and none of them are the good kind. Id rather be in a saw trap than watch this movie again.,2.0,1803
adaniel0206, Where's the movie,For any franchise fans that have been around since the early 2000s I recommend waiting for home release.The editing from floor is either a sea of footage left out or they filmed this in under a month. The film felt like it was cut to be a 90 minute trailer of what they WANT to make a new Saw movie about. It did not allow for the basic fundamentals of cinema to be utilized in scene structuring not enough beats. Just continuous punches. Chris Rock really channeled Rick Grimes with the camera eye stares.,3.0,1804
ejones3157, Get new writers.,"Predictable from the very beginning. These were the same writers who wrote Jigsaw which was easily predictable but less than this film somehow. It was so easy to tell that Chris Rocks rookie partner was behind everything it was almost laughable. Soon as he showed up on screen and begin talking I could tell it was him. I kept hoping to be thrown off but in the end that wasnt the case. With Saw X just being announced the studio needs to go with new writers or bring back the old ones. The way this one ends where the hell do you go now? Chris Rocks character knows who this guy is. I felt they kind of botched the ending. The strings holding Sam Jackson should have ripped him apart as SWAT was entering the room and then they should have shot Chris Rock while he ran in from the side. The rookie shuts the door to the elevator and laughs ""Game over"". The rest of the movie was fine. The traps werent that interesting and its different not having the presence of you know who and his puppet.",2.0,1805
darthmorbyva," Good Games, Paint By Numbers Story","Lets face it the only reason youre going to see this movie is for the elaborate deaths and games. For that I could recommend this movie but only that. I mean the acting is bad and there are some very enjoyable moments between mostly forgettable characters but where this movie really falls apart is the story and execution of it.If you watch enough movies of any genre you can start to see patterns when not so talented writers or filmmakers are behind the scenes because they use ""tropes"". I wont spoil it here but the way a particular character is introduced screams of predictability. And then about half way through the movie another moment happens for the same character and it also screams of predictability and the movie just flops it down by the end like its supposed to be from out of nowhere.",6.0,1806

gnis-732-579009, You Had Me At: MEHH,The best part of this movie is Chris Rocks thoughts about Forrest Gump. Other than that the script bad bland and the death trap scenes were half-assed.

billybacktown, Spiraling out of Control,This movie legitimately could be the worst in the series and this is coming from a Saw fan. What makes these movies great is trying to connect the puzzle pieces as to whos behind all of this? You know you the killer is within the first 10 minutes of the movie.Chris Rock is a let down also. Give him props for stepping out of his comfort zone but man it looks like he just came out of his first acting lesson class.Save your money its awful.,4.0,1810
afrocut, Cop Tropes the movie!,"""Spiral: from the book of Saw"" Is  for the lack of a better word Terrible. It fails horribly on every front. Its mystery is obvious. Its scares are nonexistent. The directing is stale and generic. The acting is laughably forced and over the top. And the script well its garbage. Chris Rock is a cop who the film wants us to believe is a good cop the best cop even so good in fact that he doesnt do anything by the rules. This includes touching evidence with bare hands not recognizing his best friends wedding ring watch clothes opening random packages delivered to the police station plugging in random usb drives into police computers not actually figuring out any clues and never saving anyone. He also is an over acting one line spouting cop movie stereotype to the point of embarrassment. He drives a muscle car has a new partner turned a dirty cop in is hated by other cops and he even has a father who was the chief of police. This is some lazy writing. It gets worse. The traps make no sense theres no creepy puppet theres no creepy voice... but luckily it has one thing going for it the gore. When its shown its pretty good looking. It isnt enough to save this dud though. In fact if Im being honest this is the worst of the franchise.",4.0,1811
emilybedford," Tame, but still good",I was super nervous about going into Spiral seeing as Saw is one of my favourite franchises. Chris Rock was an interesting choice as the main role it took a while for me to not think of Marty from Madagascar. Once i got over that i found his performance quite impressive.There was a disappointing amount of traps and while the traps were interesting i felt them to be tame in comparison to previous movies and the victims to be less desperate to get out of said traps. I was massively disappointed in the use of a new puppet and new voice over but I guess i can understand why it was changed. It was also rather disappointing that within the first 20 minutes guessed who Jigsaw was.Overall it was quite a good movie in itself the intrigue was there the loose ends were tied will there be another one? I couldnt tell you. But again Saw is one of my favourite franchises and i would gladly go see any future movies.,7.0,1812
gpeterson-09509, Decent pop-corn eating flick.,This movie was great but its saw. Its not suppose to blow you away with an oscar worthy story. The movies entertaining despite its flaws and thats all you can really ask for from a franchise built on jump scares and gore.,7.0,1813
greenbizkit33, Well done movie,I been a fan of the Saw series since the first one and all but that one confusing one. This one came off as a good addition to the series. I think more effort was put into the movie then last few ones. Chris Rock and Samuel Jackson was a nice addition.I was very worried that they would inject social messages into the movie because of the plot. But I am happy to say they resisted. It is about bad cops but the way they did it it was not related to recent events .,7.0,1814
tloader-1, Too ordinary for a Saw movie,The thing I loved about all the previous Saw movies was the intricate plots and great twists at the end. In this one the plot was fairly standard and the twist predictable.Chris Rocks over the top performance didnt suit the role at all although the other actors did a great job.The traps were also boring and there was no tension or thought that they would escape at the end.It wasnt a terrible movie but a very average police procedural with some generic Saw traps.,6.0,1815
bangel3322, Very average,While this had some good moments and good traps and a decent storyline this isnt anything special or new and should have been far more superior than it was. Chris Rock was better than I expected but I still think Id like to have seen someone else in the role. Unfortunately though this was far too predictable as its very obvious early on who the Jigsaw copycat is. Unlike other films there wasnt much subtlely. A shame as they had an opportunity here to make something really exciting.,5.0,1816
ljayharbour, Astonishing!!,This new chapter in the Saw series is a great start! Chris Rock did an awesome job leading the film! I like that the audience is thrown right into the thrilling action at the very start! The comedy was just enough and not too obnoxious. The jigsaw traps were not as gory as past films but was enough to make you cringe. I wish the movie was a bit longer and spent more time on the backstory of the other officers. I feel like the ending was too abrupt but I understand its setting up future films. I am pleased overall and cant wait to see the future of Saw.,7.0,1817

rubenpasaribu, Spiral is an entertaining and fun thriller.,Spiral: From The Book of Saw is a spin off movie set in the universe of Saw. The movie tells an interesting and new story that feels different compared to the other Saw movies but not too different where it doesnt resemble a Saw movie. The movie is filled with sadistic traps and Saw fans will not be disappointed with the amount of gore in this movie. With that being said the plot twist of the killers reveal is sadly lacking compared to previous movies. Spiral: From The Book of Saw indicates a brighter future for the Saw franchise.,8.0,1819
tresm87," Chris Rock didn't ""wanna play a game"" with his failed attempt at a serious role, but a spiraling story, Darren Bousman's brutal directing makes this a passable spinoff.",When this was announced and I saw it was starring Chris Rock I was very skeptical of him being attached but the trailers still showed a great deal of grime and decent resemblance of the lengthy Saw franchise. Well now that I finally saw it my fears of a failed attempt at a serious Chris Rock portrayal became all too real. His acting is absolutely atrocious and cannot be taken seriously especially in this grizzled franchise. There are times where you can literally see him almost laugh or crack a smile in the actual film. NOT ALL comedians can translate their comedy into versatile serious roles like certain legends. This trend of comedians trying to go serious is getting to be tiresome imo.Story wise its actually serviceable for the most part aside from forced biased propaganda that was inevitable with Rock involved especially in this insane day and age. The plotting is rather predictable but there are still solid thriller aspects that are digestible and it has some vibrant suspense toward the end. Some twists and turns keep it interesting and familiar enough though I personally couldnt take the killers disguised voice seriously either. Sam Jackson is always enjoyable and Max Mingella brings solid support.The real standout and somewhat saving grace for the film is the directing from Bousman who also directed Saw 2/3/4. He creates a visceral environment full of colorful settings relentless brutality and crisp camerawork overall. Hes a director that has shown some serious potential and a keen eye for horror.Overall this is a passable spinoff that offers some new bloodshed in the franchise yet suffers extremely from Rock forcing a serious role. Id even go as far as saying if they got a more proper actor for the main role it wouldve elevated the film drastically. It doesnt break any new ground but has enough to keep fans intrigued and Bousman seems to have the ability to still keep the franchise going.,6.0,1820
maherbrandon-67670, I AM IN PURE SHOCK,I just finished watching spiral and let me tell you its incredible. The acting the cinematography the traps and the story were all fantastic.

natashialw, Loving this!!!,I had some doubts what with a comedian like Chris Rock and Sam Jackson you wouldnt expect in a SAW movie. I grew up on this franchise since I was 13 years old and to this day the SAW franchise will always be my fave. Chris Rock did right by fans! I hope there is a direct sequel to this one day that connects with Jigsaw (2017).Only gave it 7/10 because I miss Billy and Johns voice and some small hopes or expectations of cameos from past characters other than that the story was thrilling and the traps gorey as always!,7.0,1822
jodihaynes, Spiral is bloody fantastic,I had a few issues with some dialogue but overall spiral from the book of saw is one of the strongest in the franchise and really digs in with character development than previous saw movies didnt .

Entertainmentsparadise, This is not the movie for Chris Rock!,A detective attempts to figure out who is gruesomely killing cops.The film establishes the killers motive without building depth. I was not engaged as the film went on to the point of I didnt care who the killer was.Chris Rocks performance was over the top not convicting and too comical for this horror/ thriller film. With his outrageous facial expressions and high pitched voice that didnt match any of his emotional expressions. Its clear to see that this movie was just some killings and a predictable yet effective plot twist.Overall terrible job I damn near walked out the theater half way through the film. This shouldve went straight to dvd. No need for this to be in a theater.,2.0,1824

tim_d3, Chris Rock? Seriously?,"Am I dreaming? How much did he influence (read: pay) the franchise to take part in it? Are there any sane producers that thought: ""yes casting a guy renown for comedy is a splendid idea."" Is it the connected Hollywood machine rearing its ugly head? Its hard to take the actor serious despite him trying very hard. Even bolstered with comedic script lines. The real comedy is that Saw of all franchises is greedy enough to do stunts like that. Using the original saw music and homage does not do anything. The Emperors New Clothes come to mind. I guess all the original writers and staff left and these are the scraps they throw to whatever is left of the Saw audience nowadays.",5.0,1827
valleyjohn, Nothing new here,"I must be a glutton for punishment ( no pun intended) as Ive now watched all 9 SAW films. The original was great  some were ok and others were awful .This  although not strictly a Jigsaw movie  comes under the ok barrier .Working in the shadow of his father an esteemed police veteran  brash Detective Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks and his rookie partner take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the citys gruesome past. Unwittingly entrapped in a deepening mystery Zeke finds himself at the center of the killers morbid game.This has all the hallmarks of a Saw movie but really isnt as the story revolves around a copycat killer but thats ok . There is only so many times Jigsaw can come back from the dead !The pluss point of the film is that it stars  Chris Rock who is actually pretty good although its strange not to see that distinctive smile. Not even once.The story is predictable and plods along fine and we get to see the inventive forms of torture we have come accustomed to and these are particularly gruesome.I must admit  an hour in I was drifting off a bit . I was getting a little bored but thankfully its only ninety minutes long which is more than enough .Im sure it wont take me long for this to drift from my memory and be just another of Saw series .Unremarkable.",6.0,1828
chrisdye-08398, first saw movie ive ever seen but not too bad,Okay so lets start by saying this isnt usually my kind of movie but it was really a good film though not for everyone its quite a movie it has a good story and plenty of action and adventure the horror level here is low however suspense is actually quite high rock really shines here as does jackson its one of the best horrors of the decade so much enjoyment to have here definitley not for everyone and absolutly not for kids of any age but the age intended and not for the faint at heart but really a good movie.,8.0,1829
huntersmithx, A somewhat refreshing but disjointed affair.,The 2000s were a strange decade for Horror and while there was no shortage of quality outings standouts included increasingly preposterous sagas like Saw and Paranormal Activity. The little home-grown movies that could each grew into those Horror parodies you see in childrens cartoons. The most unlikely of superstars Chris Rock has now collaborated with Lionsgate and director Darren Lynn Bousman to jumpstart Saw with a revival that has some back to basics thrown in. Spiral is trying to be for this franchise like New Nightmare was for A Nightmare on Elm Street in the 90s- and it halfway succeeds. It may just be on par with the original installment in terms of creativity and thematic links to David Finchers Seven and theres certainly no contest between this and the Red Bull fueled froth that came in between- but its also ham-fisted to a fault.It should be no surprise nowadays when a comedic actor or creator reinvents themselves with Horror or Drama (Jordan Peele Craig Mazin with Chernobyl) so Rock delivers as Det. Zeke Banks with sincerity. With his manifesto from years back comes a slew of humor that appeals to a more diverse audience. Samuel L. Jackson as Zekes father/retired police chief is entertaining and scene-chewing as always. Hes however not in this film as much as you might be led to believe giving more room for Rock to steal the show.Its injections of comedic relief are cringey at times but certainly a cut above the worst moments in It: Chapter Two and some of the Marvel installments. The direction and production values are also at times noteworthy; with the sepia-toned heat wave induced big city and its urban atmosphere help breathe new life.However the direction also comes a good amount of the typical Saw schtick- high-pitched jump scares and gimmicky editing. Many trailers arent as bad as a number of cinephiles make them out to be but heres an exception. The first trailer show a level of nuance in maneuvering suspense much better than the final product: because much of the dialogue is clunky shouty and almost incapable of understatement- save for the final twist that pays off many of the themes and imagery set up throughout. They also mirror our more socially conscious country and the roles of good and bad cops (guess what the dead pigs that Jigsaw used to use is brought back as symbolism for). Its a very 2020 Horror film and probably not as clever as it could be but the final twist and elements in between may just as well be the next best thing for this dinosaur franchise.Grade- 2.5 out of 4 stars.,7.0,1830
influxtwo, From the Book of Sigh.,Ive seen every SAW movie. I liked the first spin-off JigSaw. This one has potential but the Who-dunnit aspect and such was a bit cliche and not very impactful. JigSaw really had a shocking ending this one wasnt quite as shocking. Part of it was the twist only works because the screenplay lies to the audience so the reveal felt flat this time around and less omg how didnt I see that coming?. The music acting and production quality wasnt too bad but the story rushes along. This series feels more brief and small and less grand despite the decent actors. I wasnt very disappointed just quite underwhelmed. They spent 40 million dollars on this? I never wouldve known. I really recommend seeing this for free instead of paying. Its just not that special. A decent cliff note for the series nonetheless.,6.0,1831
FeastMode," not bad, but also not good",I was excited when this movie opened with an awesome trap shown in a perfect way with close-ups at first before finally revealing the entire thing similar to how someone who is regaining consciousness might experience it. Then we delve into the new tone if the movie which i also liked. Same with the chris rock comedy. The setup was good and the story was intriguing.But it did not culminate into anything of note and ranged from mediocre to disappointing for the second half of the movie. The traps were okay and i feel like there were only four of them. And to make it worse for two of them they let you know the player didnt survive before showing you the trap which defeats the purpose and removes the tension.All in all i liked the idea and the new tone and i didnt have a bad time with the movie. I will probably give it another chance. And i would be curious to see a continuation of the story. But imo this is worse than any of the original 7 and on par with jigsaw (part 8). And this is almost exactly what i said about jigsaw (1 viewing 5/14/2021)SPOILERSthe most disappointing part about this movie is that i guessed the reveal. Guess isnt the right word. I knew who the killer was at about the halfway point and never waivered after that. This has never happened to me with any of the previous 8 movies even sometimes on second viewing. Maybe its more difficult to surprise a seasoned fan of the series. But that argument cant be used when the first 8 repeatedly surprised me. And it wasnt even clever.,5.0,1832
mancini1997, Extremely Predictable... Lame twist ending that ruins the movie,"I typically like going to the ""Saw"" movies but this one had such a predictable ending that is was laughable.

themadpredator, Go Watch Spiral!,Spiral: From the Book of Saw is an excellent new addition to the Saw franchise. Everything was improved on. From the locations to the traps its amazing. Series veteran Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw 2 3 4) directs this film and was a perfect choice to come back and take the helm again. Jigsaw (2017) writers Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg return to write. Combining Darren with the writers was a great choice. They keep elements that made the films iconic and changed it up. New puppet voice etc. With all these new changes and seeing how it all played out Im really excited to see where this all leads next. All in all Id say this was worth the wait. Go ahead and give it a watch as soon as you can!,9.0,1834
UniqueParticle, Amazing for fans!,First time seeing two different IMAX movies in the same day I got to see Wrath of Man as well thats irrelevant but amazing too. Darren Lynn Bousman continued a beloved horror franchise with new faces Im proud of Chris Rock being in horror I dont think hes done anything like it! Spiral is just as gruesome as any of the Saw films with a little bit of comedy dirty cops and plenty of games to be played. Well worth the money and better than a lot of the sequels.,9.0,1835
NuikopeaDemon, Bloody Amazing and Worth The Watch,Spiral: From the Book of SAW isnt like the previous SAW films so dont expect to hear the iconic JIGSAW voice as seeing this is a copycat killer whos targeting corrupt cops and unlike other SAW films this movie has a decent amount of comedic moments which some might find annoying or hilarious depends on how open your mind is but as this movie is a Spinoff.But if youre a true fan of the series then you will definitely enjoy this movie like even with the funny moments there is a lot of moments where it was very violent and I cant complain about it the gore was realistic good and also the traps were so beautiful and sick as with every other SAW filmThe music oh yes the music was also very good and Charlie Clouser did come back to help with the iconic music.So I definitely rate this movie a 10/10 I do recommend it for sure and I hope you all enjoy the movie.,10.0,1836
joiningjt," Sorry didnt buy chris rock as a tough cop, story was mediocre ,We Missed jigsaw!!",Didnt have a great story like the original didnt have a character that grabs you like jigsaw. Ending was weak and the ending saw twist was now where near as good as most saws. Sorry Chris but didnt like you in fargo and didnt like you here. It might just be me maybe seeing him as a stand up comic to much but his acting delivery seems the same as his stand up. And his presence just doesnt transfer into drama horror or him being a tough guy. Was ok once but not theater or bluray worthy its a Netflix or cable watch film.,5.0,1837
jamesmjohnson-03371, Best one since Saw II,A really great way to start the series back up again. I couldve used more traps but overall it was a great movie. Chris rock brings a bit of comedy to the serious movie. And the twist at the end was really great.,7.0,1838
ignacio-lopezmoreno, Disrespectful with the saga and horrible performances,The rhythm of the plot was fast and devoid of real emotions. The use of the camera in some moments is absurd and abuses cheap tricks. It is obvious who is responsible after 20 minutes and it is ridiculous how they try to play with the protagonist. By the way lousy update for Chris Rock and unfortunately for Samuel L. Jackson it seems that if its not Tarantino they dont know how to guide him.,3.0,1839
axfan64, Spiral: The original Saw you remember and Saw like you've never seen,First off Ive been a fan of the Saw franchise since 2009. Ever since Ive probably seen each one of them at least a few times. So when I heard about this film in February 2020 I got super pumped for Spiral. That was until its inevitable delay to May 2021. I still did not give up hope. I knew they would come up with an amazing story that would satisfy Saw fans and possibly invite new fans to the franchise.Thats brings up to May 13th 2021. One year later. Was it worth the wait? The short answer: HELL YES!!It is one of the best Saw movies in the franchise. Top 3 easily in my opinion. Darren Lynn Bousman did an amazing job directing this one after Saw II III and IV. The atmosphere in this film was great with the shades of yellows and blues in the frame were a nice change in pace from what were used to. The story was fantastic. Chris Rock holds his own in a horror/thriller movie so hopefully that kills any doubt you had that a comedic actor such as himself couldnt make this work.Dont get me wrong while this movie looks and feels like a Saw movie it stands apart in many ways. This is very much inspired by Se7en especially when dealing with the aftermath of the victims. The buddy cop element is present as well giving a new way for the franchise to add some depth to its characters. Chris Rock and Max Minghella play well together as Zeke and William respectively bouncing banter off each other making for some funny comedic moments.The traps were simple and brutal just the way the original Saw was although much more bloody and graphic. Not over the top like some of the last few Saw movies. The concepts behind them were very inventive and added more purpose to the story even. So if youre a gore fan theres plenty for you to marvel at.Theres plenty more I can say about how great this movie was. It is Saw like you remember with an extra Se7en-inspired heart. I cannot recommend this movie more. Congratulations to Chris Rock Max Minghella Samuel Jackson Marisa Nichols and Darren Lynn Bousman. Cant wait to see it again soon!,10.0,1840
rclakers, Some People with Negative Reviews need to Relax lol,I think some people went into this movie expecting to see the Mona Lisa. Relax. This is a Saw movie for crying out loud. And its a pretty damn good one. The plot is solid from beginning to end and the traps are simple but brutal. Its very entertaining the whole way through. The minor downsides were that there was some overacting every once in a while and it wasnt too hard to figure out who the killer was. It doesnt take away from enjoying the movie though. I enjoyed Chris Rocks character very much. My advice for this movie would be to just relax and dont have ridiculous expectations for it. If you do this youll have a good time.,10.0,1841

JackCowart34," Yeah, I got my hopes up too high for this movie.",Spiral the next chapter in a saw franchise that started out so promising under the steady direction of James Wan but has since resorted to Darren Lynn Bousman again who handled it with much less finesse. The script couldve used pretty much a complete overhaul. The dialogue consisted of continuous screaming and cussing for no apparent reason. The camera work was pretty chaotic I think he used too much shaky cam and maintained a tone that made the movie unenjoyable. You could tell the movie was high budget due to the quality of its set pieces and effects not to mention the two A list actors. The funny thing is I think that they were both miscast. Im sorry but Chris Rock in this type of movie just didnt do it for me. He was whiny angry and his performance lacked the depth I was expecting. As for Samuel L. Jackson Ive never been a big fan of the majority of his performances (Except for Pulp Fiction of course). The kills were pretty inventive with plenty of gore as Saw fans have come to expect. I probably wont ever watch this movie again but it was fun being in the theatre. Overall Id say its one of the weakest entries in the franchise.,4.0,1845

usirgkw, Woke up thinking about it ðŸ˜³,When was the last time you saw a movie that everyone was excited to continue talking about afterwards? And that you and multiple friends woke up thinking about? ðŸ˜³Spiral feels like more than just a return to form for a franchise it feels like a horror movie being made by masters of their craft that want to remind youthat this genre can stir you up like no other and it really does leave you with... feelings.The traps are disgusting - they left memore uncomfortable than previous traps but thats not just because of what they did but the amazing performances leading up to them especially Chris Rock who I quickly forgot was Chris Rock. Thats not something I expected and nor was a great supporting cast around him. Theres no dead wood here and thats also true of the pacing which is smart and slick and modern. You wont find many horror cliches here and its all the better for it feeling fresh and confident. This movie reminded me why I love horror.,10.0,1848

ollieharrison-76586, A love letter to the fans of Saw! Invest in your fans!,If youre going to see this movie because you heard Samuel. L. Jackson is in it or for some reason you want to see the voice of Marty from Madagascar in what looks like a cop drama; this isnt the movie for you. This is a movie made for the original fans of the films and when I say that I mean the viewing experience between those who havent seen the originals those who have seen the originals but dont like Saw and those who love Saw will be drastically different.Which is why I suggest that if youre going to see Spiral watch the originals first. Story wise it doesnt really connect at all with the original other then the occasional reference to John Kramer and the fact he was the original Jigsaw killer but other then that this is its own movie. The reason I suggest you watch it because of the way the narrative is written and how it unfolds. I would say Spiral is a Saw movie but clearly as the description shows; its a revival of the series.The traps still unfold the same way thematically throughout the film somewhat but its the films final 10 mins or so where it really shines as a Saw film. Yes the plot twist was predictable and the supporting characters were 2D and unimaginative but the story does well to really make you side with the villains in this. Just like 10 years ago when Saw fans low key understood John Kramers reasoning and respected his art.Now for the cons of the film: Chris Rocks acting is subpar at best and I could not stop seeing Marty from Madagascar throughout the film.The plot twist was predictable although I liked it all the same.There were one or two scenes from a narrative perspective that I wouldve changed to different points in the movie to to make the plot more interesting.Finally the 21 Savage theme Spiral is god awful and Its stuck in my head. It tries to remix the original theme and just does a woefully terrible job.All in all though regardless of the above I praise this movie because I could clearly see they made it for the fans not for all audiences. Yes its rough around the edges but what Hollywood needs during covid now is to invest in their fan base and not satisfy all audiences. Companies like WB in particular need to look at this and learn otherwise their Fantastic Beasts franchise is going to flop worse then their Justice League franchise did.I would really like to see this story continue in someway as Im really invested in the villain and his motives. I also think that baring some things this film was written and story boarded well and it was nice to see some enjoyable comedy in a Saw film for a fresh change.,8.0,1853
raymj777, Cliche and predictable,"Every cop movie cliche in the first five minutes (broken marriage loner cop forced to take on a new partner obvious red herrings etc.).

coreylukeh, You SAW It Coming....,The most predictable Saw twist YET !Im a huge fan of the SAW franchise so was very much looking forward to this I knew itd be going in a new direction but this is probably too far different.Tobin Bells voice is replaced with what sounds like a female robot.The Billy puppet is replaced with a pig puppet dressed as a cop.Chris rock is surprisingly not too bad in the role.Samuel Jackson out acts everyone and delivers all his famous one liners.The film doesnt care for the traps the traps arent the focus its the twist BUT you and everyone around you guessed the killer within 20 minutes !!!And the reveal of the copycat jigsaw is shockingly underwhelmingChris rock turns a corner to see the killer just stood there. Thats it.,5.0,1856
Farshnoshket, Not worth anyone's time,You would have figured this long from the last Saw film (4 years?) someone wouldve come up with a good story that might have what most of the prior films lacked but none of this has happened with the newest version Spiral. After reading a lot of the reviews here I think many have forgotten what made the first film so great and it was all the torture scenes. Creating the torture scenes is the easy part. Give yourself 10 minutes and you can create a good one yourself. On the other hand the twist? The twist in the first film was genius and theyve been trying ever since to come up with something close but they failed big time with this one. Yeah the film was really gory. Like we didnt expect that. Not only was this film missing the best element it also veered too far off the path for my taste. We all knew there would have to be a new killer but why is he killing? Is he killing for a similar reason that Jigsaw did? Instead this film is more like your typical revenge flick. Not only that but it was waaaaay too easy to figure out waaaaay before we were supposed to. They totally underutilized Sam Jackson in the film and should have instead to find a way for him to have more time on screen. Big mistake. The acting was slightly better than most of the sequels but definitely not any better to make any difference. The entire film felt lazy to me.I think that worst part might come near the end when the killer reveals all. If you think about what the person said you should realize that they could have accomplished the same a lot easier than the round about way it was designed. Like Nike say Just do it!.Somewhere out there theres someone who could write a great new version of Saw but Josh Stolberg & Pete Goldfinger arent 2 of them.Of course the film ends where the viewer is left thinking there could be another but I guarantee that wont be happening.,5.0,1857
lionvanslion, Spiral retreads over same dull path.,"So Ive been into Saw since the very first film released when I rented it at my local Blockbuster Since then Ive seen every film in theaters.Despite being swept away by the current hype of each film and my younger less developed mind I claimed each subsequent sequel as the best entry in the series.After the series ended and by the time 2017s Jigsaw rolled around my firm stance was that the first two Saw films are the only truly good ones through and through.Nonetheless I went into Spiral really looking forward to it. There were many reasons to expect it to be promising... bringing Darren Bousman back as director a great cast promising teaser back in 2020 and I was very stoked.After seeing the movie last night I was severely let down mainly due to the writing.Before I talk about my negative feelings with Spiral I do acknowledge that its better than the past few Saw sequels... yet thats not really a high bar at all thus the problem.The story was so paint by numbers and the ending twist should have been so much more... just like ""Jigsaw"" even more so actually because Spiral had a complete fresh slate to do whatever they wanted and they chose a twist ending that was so bland and anti-climactic...Spiral ignored like Twist-Ending 101 --- there was no subverting of expectations no multi-layered twists (a la Saw 2) no surprise reveals misdirection etc...Instead of having William as the killer they shouldve had him be a red-herring  and do something like simultaneously revealing that William was just a pawn like Zepp or blackmailed maybe introduce the real killer while having a time twist be revealed...They should have executed the twist in a clever way that pleases fans of the early Saw films like Saw 1 and 2 while also pleasing newcomers.For example the killer is targeting cops they could have found a way to have Daniel Mathews (Erik Knudsen) be the killer... or maybe the drill chair test survivor from the first Saw... maybe Daniel is targeting corrupt cops because he hated his dad and the emotional neglect he put him through and they could execute it in an epic way that would be like epic on its own if youve never seen any Saw movies but twice the epic-ness if you know who Daniel Mathews is!And then an epic time twist or something reveal the bathroom or the Saw 2 house in an epic way. I really thought this film was going to take place around the time Saw 2 took place or something or have some connection to the first two films.They should really loosely follow the blueprint of the original Saw for the main story like two (or three) people trapped in a room and thats the main plot of the story like the Bathroom in Saw 1 and have a twist ending like Saw 2 - misdirection time twist unexpected killer etc.And just the overall story was terrible Josh Stolberg (the writer) holy smokes... why the studios didnt think to look elsewhere for a new writer/s is beyond me. Jigsaw was dogsh** so they cleaned house and got a new director and cast studio wanted a new direction with the story along with Chris Rocks idea so its dumbfounding that they kept the same writers as Jigsaw. Horrendously insulting story and dialogue and twist.Overall I still rank Spiral higher than everything past Saw 3. Not a huge compliment.",5.0,1858
dy38493, Very good movie,I am a fan of saw movies so I like this movie but this movie is little bit more watchable than other saw movies the direction is perfect and acting is fabulous.,5.0,1859
codylbrowne, A refreshing take on the Saw franchise,Chris Rock makes an unlikely appearance as both write and star of the ninth Saw entry and his contributions breathe new life into a tired franchise. Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson essentially play themselves but their comedic quips dont detract from their believable participation in the cop-killer mystery. In fact their comedic chops lend well to the campy ridiculousness inherent to the Saw series.Chriss story is also very in line with Saws typical social commentary and the twist villain is very fitting for the film. While not a perfect movie by any means Spiral is a fun welcome entry to the horror franchise and leaves me hopeful for even more future entries with the same amount of love put in.,7.0,1860
zacharyjuly, No expectations going in,I really enjoyed this movie I was skeptical going into it because some of the saw movies solely rely on gore. This movie is Gorey but there is a pretty good plot to back behind it as well as a good cast with good acting. Overall I left the theater happy because it wasnt just all bloody torture scenes but there are definitely some in there.,8.0,1861
ryanwesthamfan, Nice Addition To The Saw Films,The Good- Firstly I really enjoyed the mystery element of this film not really knowing whats going on or who is behind everything thats happening that really intrigued me. I also thought that the film found very clever ways to show of the traps and situations that our characters are in. Chris Rock was very entertaining to watch in the main role I didnt think I would enjoy seeing him as a detective but he really surprised me.The Mixed- Now Samuel L Jacksons character is very important to the film and script and he is connected to everything however he doesnt have lots of screen time. If you are expecting lots from him youll probably be disappointed.The Bad- Straightaway we have seen these types of characters and films before the rogue detective and charismatic villain has all been done before. Finally I thought the final twist was fairly predictable. There was one scene where the film was basically telling you what the final twist was going to be and that sort of cheapened the moment for me.Overall Im going to give Spiral: From The Book Of Saw a 7/10.,7.0,1862
PCC0921," Very Good Performances, Good Story, Convincing Effects, No Frights Though",Released: May 14th 2021Viewed: May 19th 2021Horror films these days have become something other than horror films. We have pushed the envelope so far on the serious violence subject that the movies themselves arent really scary anymore just kinda gross. Because of TV shows like CSI (2000 - 2015) the Walking Dead (2010 - Present) the age of streaming services making it easier for access to R rated content and changing attitudes on violence in movies/TV shows we have come to a point where we have seen everything. I mean really how many different ways can you mutilate the human body? Plus knowing that it is fake (not criticizing the effects in some of these films) and with all that Hollywood magic thrown in also makes it easier not to be scared.We have come to a point where horror films need other angles to make them appealing today. So for me my angle was concentrating on the very interesting idea of seeing Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson being serious in a slasher/gore film. Of course Samuel L. Has done plenty of serious work but it was the idea of Chris Rock taking on a serious role that Ive never seen before. The closest serious dramatic role Ive ever seen him in was probably Lethal Weapon IV (1998). What is even more intriguing is the fact that Rock plays Jacksons son in this film.Rock plays Police Detective Zeke Banks whos father once was a legendary Police Captain who was busy hunting down Jigsaw during the old Saw days. On the day Banks gets a new partner (Max Minghella) fellow detectives of Banks start disappearing and falling prey to a new copycat killer named Spiral. A pretty basic plot but it does deliver a few surprises and turns.What it didnt do was scare me. I didnt flinch at all and this film had plenty of the cheap flashed jump-cuts for fright purposes and those werent working either. As I said earlier horror films are not scary anymore just cartoonishly gross and silly. I am not criticizing the effects in this film because they are good and convincing when looking at them from a creative and designed point of view. When it comes to frights this one needed to use its next best cards to make this film enjoyable.That card falls to the performances of Chris Rock and his supporting cast who all do a pretty good convincing job. In the case of Rock its almost weird watching him do a serious Chris Rock but with a gritty edge that was very cool fresh and likeable. He wanted to tell us that there was no time for comedy only serious stuff. Samuel L. Jackson does what he does well. He executes the qualities and attributes of his character needed to sell it to an audience And he does it without over-doing it. What makes him so good is his ability to simplify the issue because an energetic amplified personality like him could fall prey to over-acting but Jackson gets the job done again.The rest of the cast is a cast of virtual unknowns who do a good job but deflate some of the energy in the room being generated by Rock and Jackson. The next biggest cast member after Minghella is Marisol Nichols who plays the current Police Captain. She manages to feed on the emotions of the audience. It was her character that helped generate the second guessing of where this story ends up.Go into this movie looking for suspense a good murder mystery fresh performances and a psychological thriller. Try and take the gore as flashy make-up effects and try to remember its all fake so it doesnt ruin the rest of the film for you. I still consider a film with a 6 IMDB a good film and worth seeing but Id save your money and go to $5 Tuesday night instead of the regular theater price. I will say this though Chris Rock was pretty good. I like his serious side.6.1 (D+ Mygrade) = 6 IMDB.,6.0,1863
edwincervantes70," Formulaic, predictable, yet nevertheless a welcoming entry to the Saw franchise.",The first Saw was a great film that featured a nice balance between mystery and suspense and the blood and gore which I felt was overused in the franchise. What I enjoyed about this particular film was how it partially returned to the mystery detective roots of the first two ones. Spiral is not only a good addition to the Saw franchise for toning down the gore in exchange for mystery and suspense.The film is also a great satire on the modern problem of police brutality. Chris Rocks Zeke Banks was someone I could easily root for in the entire film. Despite delivering his usual comedic chops Rocks Zeke was likeable from the start for being a dedicated officer willing to uphold the law which made him my third favorite cop after Agent Peter Strahm and Detective David Tapp. The ending I definitely enjoyed. In keeping tradition with the last minute plot twists that come with the franchise making Samuel L. Jacksons Chief Banks as a tritagonist was a nice touch.His character was someone I almost rooted for for apparently being a crusader for justice like Zeke and being protective of his son. What I didnt expect was him being the one who encouraged his officers to break the laws they were supposed to upheld. The ending was a nice touch and homage to the first film. Watching Zeke feel helpless when a SWAT team accidentally gun down his father (as revenge by Zekes partner for the death of his own) was a nice callback to the first film when Adam could only scream helplessly after losing the game.Overall Spiral is a welcoming addition to the Saw franchise and managed to concoct a good plot twist of tritagonists which Jigsaw (2017) was trying to pull.,7.0,1864
nflshowdown2, Saw... Meh,"I am probably among the biggest Saw fans out there and I even loved Jigsaw to show you where Im at in life ... So I think its relevant information to mention this because of the amount of reviews from people who dont like the series (go away) or dont know anything about it. I come from a place of real admiration for the series so far though we all know Saw 3D and Saw V were real horrible.Anyway I was overall disappointed with this film overall. The big positive for me are the traps... and if I ranked them they would probably be in the order they appear in the film - from the first one being the best and the last one being the worst. I dont know if that is generally the order they were striving for but it is a high point of the film. Mostly creative satisfyingly shot and specific to the characters being tested. The intensity is also turned up for me to 11 throughout the film.. especially being a Saw film. Youre on the edge of your seat because you know the type of stuff you are in for in these films. Ultimately I was disappointed in what we got out of it... but I was engaged throughout. I have less of an issue with the acting than most people. The acting in the traps is on point Chris Rock was a solid enough protagonist and the ensemble cast is adequate.I posed the following question to the person I saw the film with and I will to you .. if you took out the traps you took out the Saw lore.. would you still have a good movie? My answer is an absolute ""No."" It is at best a police drama you would find on cable like NYPD BlueX A combination of poor dialogue pacing concerns and an predictable ending has me believing without the ""Saw"" name this movie would never have gotten made. The characters outside of the main 4 in the billing are completely one sided and cardboard. You cant route for anyone in the film they dont want you to route for.I think we should expect more than this as fans and some day I hope we get it. 5/10... and I hope they make more :P.",6.0,1865

hometuff," Interesting, especially with a super pissed off Chris Rock","I enjoyed Chris Rocks portrayal of his character as an uber angry detective who had turned in a dirty cop early in his career and has been seen as a snitch by all fellow police ever since and hes none too happy about that. Were all use to seeing him in the comedic role so this was refreshing. That being said he was not totally believable as an angry cop. You always have the sense that he was going to burst out laughing. There were a couple of believable ""angry"" moments but just a couple. Im not necessarily a ""Saw"" person and enjoyed this iteration. The movie has its usual interesting and unique bloody scenes. I didnt see the ending coming and it kept my interest throughout and Rocks and. Jacksons performances were entertaining so it gets a 7.",7.0,1867
garrettpeery, Love Samuel L Jackson.. but that's about it,The movie of course is so promising .. all the gore content movie goers seek when seeing a slasher film is weaved perfectly into this movie. Samuel L Jackson delivers as usual and is truly my fav part of the movie!! However maybe Im just picky but I hated the ending. It started to become really predictable and the ending wasnt something I wanted to happen so I dont recommend wasting your money on it like I left the theater so pissed off about it.

seanmills-90674, Identity Crisis,While the budget and production value has been boosted the film has a major identity crisis.

cindyxie-78638, Just not a great experience story wise.,Note: I havent watched any other saw movies so take this with a grain of salt.Off the bat some of the dialogue was just clunky and some camera work and sound effects were just downright funny. I am not very knowledgeable in horror or gore oriented films but I had no problem with most of the puzzle scenes. I took the most issue with the movies message since its weirdly both pro and anti cop and didnt leave me with any meaningful experience. Overall just felt kind of devoid of message which could be fine but the traps and suspense werent good enough to make up for its lack of intent.,4.0,1870

Ive been a fan of the series since the first part. Love how the six parts complete the story. They could have taken saw in a great direction from that point but chose to try and reboot it.

momster64, Save your money..,"As with a lot of reviewers I had high hopes for this movie since there was first talk of it. Cant verbalize how disappointed I am now that Ive seen it.Each and every overused cop movie trope and cliche was used. Some more than once. Chris Rock had one expression the entire movie which was a confused/angry/squinty grimace. Unfortunately his acting left a lot to be desired and I half expected him to break into a comic bit. His precinct associates were overblown stereotypes. Way too many instances of ""that wouldnt ever happen that way"" that I could not ""suspend disbelief"" for very long.The supposed connection to the actions of Jigsaw was so loose that Im pretty sure you could remove that aspect of the story and it wouldnt make a difference at all.Not to mention you could figure the identity of the perpetrator from a mile away despite the dozens of red herrings thrown around and the traps set didnt hold a candle to the earlier movies.Best part of the experience was getting back into a real theater but finding a movie funny that is supposed to be scary and suspenseful was definitely a downer.",5.0,1872
rheap-47304, NO BIG IDEAS,"When Chris Rock announced that he came up with a great way to revive the franchise I was intrigued. A great idea to bring it back to life means that someone finally thought of an awesome premise to keep Lionsgates cash cow grazing away as Im sure all Lionsgate execs have been trying to think of ways since Saw VII.OK so lets imagine that the execs have been trying for 10 years to think of a good enough reason to dust off the traps. It obviously cant be something predictable. It wouldnt be the most predictable and over-used reason for reviving similar series would it? I mean ""copycat killer"" must have been suggested around the writers room ever since Saw VI and luckily we never got that in such a simple unimaginative way... until now.So lets try to look at it as the fresh take that Chris Rock intended and pretend that a copycat killer is a clever hook... Now the challenge is to create a few Saw-esque reveals and surprises to really essentially make you want to re-watch the movie. The only ""shocking"" reveal in the movie was extremely predictable - especially to torture porn Saw fans. This movie had very brief trap scenes which led to Zeke being sent body parts. Didnt they think that a body part being sent to Zeke without the viewer seeing the scenario play out for that victim would make Saw fans realise that they didnt actually see the death then ultimately assume that there must be a reason for that (otherwise why not show it?) and what better reason than because the victim never actually died? It just made it glaringly obvious who the killer was from that moment!Ultimately I cant see how anyone thought Spiral was a good enough idea to reboot the franchise. Although they wanted something fresh (I get it) I feel like they could have tied into the franchise further by using more than familiar music. Familiar sets or a motive linked back to the original movies would have been great. Why keep talking about 12 years ago if youre not going to link any of the story to events weve seen previously? The only clever nod we got was Zeke waking up handcuffed with a saw nearby and the the familiar Saw theme playing for the first time in the movie followed by him suspecting the victim in the middle of the room. With more nods like that theyd have intrigued me more as a viewer whilst not alienating anyone who hasnt seen a previous Saw instalment.I just cant see how anyone thought this idea was amazing enough to justify flogging this dead horse! Its not a bad movie when compared to something like Seven but doesnt really hit the mark as a Saw movie. At all!",5.0,1873

actaction," Awful, franchise low. Predictable, unoriginal & tired",I was excited what Chris Rock could do for a tired franchise excited about a new concept and new direction... instead its a lazy rehash slightly buzzed by a modern killer cop addition but instead of going deep on a new story or a new vibe it relies on the same tired heavy metal video editing delighting in the torture like later additions did but which the original never had to. The scary comes from the scenarios a plausible way out for a questionably evil trapped person... but when the victim is unlikable and the choices are both just as bad when its always death or mutilation thats not intense. The killer (no spoilers) is exactly who it has to be... ie there is no second guessing. I figured it out 30 min in because of lazy writing and editing that shows too much. Also be sure to show every death scene... that is so annoying when one is missing. Like duh.,3.0,1878

scragglywags101, Go In With an Open Mind...,Lets be clear this is NOT the Saw of old. The torture scenes take a backseat to the police procedurals in this one; theres maybe 5 minutes worth of trap scenes and nothing is terribly bloody. Chris Rock actually did a really good job in this role. I think the trailer made it seem like he was overacting the whole time but that wasnt the case. It was funny at times but also a decent mystery. It was more of a slow burn that culminated into an epic finale. The final 10 minutes were super intense and exactly what you would expect from a Saw movie. Sure youll probably know who the killer is by the halfway point but I dont think thats the only twist. Theres so much more going on here that will be explained in future movies.**SPOILERS** like when the wife of the first cop that was killed said that there was a black SUV sitting outside of their house before he was abducted. And then when Rock goes to the church to investigate that one dude theres the black SUV sitting out front when they get in their car. Im going to see it again to check out more things that I missed but I think there are lots in motion that this first movie wasnt able to touch up on. And the only real problem I had was that the traps were more based on revenge than redemption. Go see it but know that its a different beast this time. Its a whole new story and you wont see any old characters return. For the best. I mean Kramers been dead since 2006 let it go and move on. Bring on the next 10!,9.0,1883

maypaul-96980, The devil made me write this,I watched the conjuring: the devil made me do it last night (25.5.21) at a special pre-screening and it is A very good film. Its also different than the previous haunted house conjurings and goes for the possessed murder case (similar to the exorcism of Emily rose) but this is better.I really enjoyed it and hope for more conjuring universe movies (the crooked man),10.0,1885

equispepizarro, Exceeded my expectations,The Conjuring 3 did not expect much for the direction of Michael chavez in the curse of la llorona But I am surprised that it is well done you have very well formulated scares some heavy but it was good It maintains the suspense until the end The performance of Vera and Patrick is really incredible This story led the Warren to explore other things outside of haunted houses such as Courts morgues Tunnels this sequel if it completely changes what the previous sequels were we can even see Flashbacks of the Warren in their youth this movie It is really amazing not as much as the first one but it does not disappoint.,10.0,1889
jasongkgreen, Decent Follow Up..,"Im a fan of the Conjuring universe. You kind of know what your going to get. Well produced slick horrors with reasonable stories jump scares and well timed discordant music. They are well done.It seems the best is saved for The Conduring editions. Number 1 is a classic 2 is decent and this number 3 is a really decent love child.The production and cast are excellent Vera Farmiga I generally find a pleasure to watch Patrick Wilson adds well and is comfortable in the role.The film has some good pace and a decent story helped as always by the tenuous link to a ""based on a true story"" which always adds to these films. I think it could benefit from the tradtional horror ""no more that 1.5hrs"" and felt a little long and nearly 2 hours but not overly under-edited.Overall if you are a horror fan this will give you what you need and I suspect will become a pretty popular Horror in this excellent fanchise.Recommendation: Decent watch for Horror fans.",7.0,1890

conn-57441, A decent sequel.... without the scares!,After watching the The Conjuring: Devil made me do it at an early screening last night I have to admit I was a little disappointed that it didnt live up to the expectations of the previous two films in the main trilogy ( however it stands tall over the spin offs so dont worry there).To start off with what I did like the direction in this instalment is a nice change of pace. With the Warrens looking to save a man on death row after supposedly killing an individual while possessed by a demon. Without going into spoilers the plot shakes things up a bit from the previous two films with the likes of Satanic cults and more or a detective style approach.I personally would of loved to see more of a focus on the court side of the case and the reaction of the defendants plea it would of been a really refreshing direction for this film but what we get still isnt bad.The Warrens are still great in this film with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga having a real chemistry on screen and still being one of the most lovable protagonists in horror media in a long time.However with all this said I believe this horror film does fail in one department and that is in its scares.Its a shame to say as I believe the previous two instalments had some unique moments of terror.Whereas in this film most moments are so easily telegraphed to an obvious jumpscare that you can see a mile away or more unique set pieces unfortunately spoilt by the trailers.With all that said this is still a decent sequel just not the terrifying sequel I had hoped for!,7.0,1894
ethanc-23788, A horror movie with a heart,A thrilling third movie in a set of terrific films. It is directed beautifully and the always charming Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson take centre stage in this one more that any so far.,10.0,1895
nahyaaba, Something different and better to watch.,The conjuring the devil made me do it takes a different direction from the first 2 movies and moves away from the haunted house which was basically the only thing used. This movie is way more interesting as it always changes the atmosphere and doesnt just use a haunted house.,10.0,1896
LSUK, An above average addition to the Conjuring universe!,After watching this I can safely say this is one of the better Conjuring movies. The quality was definitely above average compared to other Conjuring movies. The first exorcism scene alone had some amazing camera-work effects and acting.It felt like the creators were a tad more aggressive with the scenes in this movie. Some of the characters get thrown around a lot more which does help make it feel a lot more authentic. Special mention to Julian Hilliard (who plays David) - he definitely has some pretty physical scenes and he did very well to make them feel authentic. Great bit of acting on his part!The story in this movie felt very polished and was portrayed well. It felt a lot more story-driven compared to other Conjuring movies and had more depth compared to others too. The horror elements are the usual Conjruing-esque jumpscares with the occasional creepy and eerie scene which definitely grabs your attention. I must say though the effects used to show the exorcisms looked amazing. The body contortions were very well done and really creeped me out!Overall an above-average addition to the Conjuring universe. Acting is great as always and a well thought out story really gave them the space to shine. No out of this world scares or anything like that (its a Conjuring movie so you know what youre in for) but definitely worth a watch in my opinion!,8.0,1897
joe-collins91, Nail biting suspense and in-your-faces scares makes this a worthy sequel,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is the third entry in The Conjuring film series (and the 8th part of The Conjuring Universe): Helmed by Michael Chaves who directed The Curse of La Llorona (an earlier and less well-received spinoff). James Wan is a co-writer and executive producer for the first time so no doubt many critics will be keeping a keen eye on Chaves as he takes the series in a new direction.The story is based on the case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson a young man who murdered his landlord and claimed that demonic forces made him commit the act. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return as ghost-hunting supremes Ed and Lorraine Warren who set out to make sense of the case and prove that demons can and do in fact take possession of people whilst convincing the high court that supernatural forces can be used as mitigating circumstances.The formula for the third entry moves away from the haunted house tropes that drove the narrative of the first two films and veers towards the possession court room drama/crime investigation and witchcraft theme and as such the film feels fresh (how many more times do we really want to see Ed and Lorraine poke around old and dusty houses?). Wilson and Farmiga prove once again that their presence is what makes these films so enjoyable and watchable. Amongst the jump scares and deafening score they offer substance and an element of humanity that really makes you root for their characters. This time around we learn even more about the Warrens how they met and how these cases affect them on a physical and emotional level. Farmiga as Lorraine Warren in particular is put through the wringer and takes centre stage. A phenomenal performer who can act her way out of a paper bag she offers one of the best character drives in the series.After a particularly intense opening scene involving the exorcism of a young boy (with nods and throwbacks to William Peter Blattys original Exorcist) complete with some body horror that would have Cronenberg wincing the story moves along swiftly onto the case of Johnson who believes that a demon is responsible for the downward spiral his life has taken. The same demon is alleged to have caused the possession of the young brother of his girlfriend and so Ed and Lorraine Warren are drafted in to solve the mystery. The set pieces are what youd expect from The Conjuring universe with the camera panning away in some dark and dimly lit basement or morgue before a big reveal that hits you square in the face like a crescendo. Unlike Chaves previous effort this one comes with greater care for the scares with the tension mounted up to extreme lengths and therefore the payoff feel earned. The central performances also add a layer of craftsmanship which makes up for the cheapness of some of the earlier spinoff entries. Ruairi OConnor gives a moody performance as Johnson and really captures the sense of dread and unnerving unknowing that befalls a character that faces a life behind bars if the burden of proof is not challenged. Alongside genre greats such as Wilson and Farmiga he more than carries the film when required to do so. The score from Joseph Bishara (who penned the score for both Conjuring films and Wans other ghost spinner Insidious) is a powerhouse of orchestral greatness with shrieking violins coming to life when the scares are meant to catch you off guard. The ingredients all form together to deliver yet another fantastic Conjuring film.If I had to give some criticism then the ending is a little slapdash and the resolve is a little sloppy and the final antagonist isnt particularly scary however by that point most people will be entirely entertained so you are likely to still come away smiling (or screaming).,8.0,1898

AdrenalinDragon, Alright sequel could be worse,Maybe Im starting to get a bit of fatigue from these Demonic/Exorcism films but it was just alright. Nothing groundbreaking and plays things straight but fairly competently shot and well executed effects. If anything the Warrens are what kept me going from start to finish. Without them it definitely wouldnt be nearly as good. The weakest of the three main Conjuring movies pretty easily though. Perhaps James Wan needs to come back. That being said could be worse.6/10.,6.0,1900
DoreaBlack, Very good,It was different from the previous Conjuring films but it was a nice change.

For the first time it really does feel the warrens are in danger. The plot is fantastic and i was hooked from the get go. Anothet fantastic entery into the Conjuring Trilogy.

azamryan, Fine but the weakest of the 3,"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It""I think its about time they accepted the existence of the Devil.""I got an exclusive early screening to see the newest and latest Conjuring film and Ive overall simply liked the first two but what did I think of this...What I liked was the plot was actually different they took a new approach with these characters and gave them a problem we havent seen them dealt with before and it was nice to see that. All performances were great they all did their best. There was a great creative scene which actually gave me chills and there were some nice shots but only a few...What I didnt like was the CGI was unfinished it was awful to look at. Also there were moments that couldve been better executed or better written they just felt a little lazy and brushed over. Ill be honest out of all 3 films this is the least scariest one no jump scare got me and the one thing that gave me chills was more of a ""Cool"" moment. I just wasnt scared not even once. I also thought the direction was boring James Wan added so much to the other two films with his directing talent but this director... just felt like plain bread. James Wan shouldve directed this.Overall I thought this was just fine a cool interesting turn in events for the main characters but lacking with any scares and boring bland direction made it the weakest of the three films. Im giving The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It ⭐⭐1/2.",5.0,1905
travisawsome, It was watchable nothing more nothing less,The devil made me do it is more of a drama than horror. With a few jump scares in between. Saying this the film did keep me so indulged and I was itching to know what happened next.,7.0,1906
anisen-undefined, First-rate performances and a gem of a film,Honestly I landed on the film last night browsing titles on Netflix because of Lily James - having known nothing else about the film from before (I usually skip trailers these days) but that she was in the cast was a huge draw for me - and found immense pleasure in this gem of a film. From Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes to Ben Chaplin and Archie Barnes the performances are all first-rate. The real-life story is told with great finesse and filmed earnestly with a keen eye for production details. I have to say even some of the lesser moments from the film shall stay with me for long its appeal is that strong.,8.0,1907
themadmovieman," An enthralling slow-burner that uses patient, understated character drama to fantastic effect",An intriguing little piece of British history The Dig tells a slow-burning story with understated and genuine drama throughout turning what could have been a rather dry tale of archaeology into a genuinely gripping character drama. Its historical context takes a little while to become fully relevant but ultimately The Dig really proves itself as a captivating watch.One of the things that I really liked about The Dig was its patience. Never dragging yet never rushing the film takes its time to build up all of its main strengths from its characters their emotional back stories and the overarching historical context of the outbreak of World War II.Complete with elegant camerawork a beautiful score and impressively atmospheric direction that makes it an eye-catching watch from the first few moments The Dig has enough confidence and depth to keep you engrossed even if its story isnt advancing apace something thats a lot harder to pull off than you may think.One of the big reasons that the films patient pacing and style work so well is because of its understated genuine drama. With calm yet fully convincing performances across the board particularly from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan this isnt a showy period drama by any means but eases you into a story about real people making them the centre of attention far more than the historical significance of the event.Im not particularly well-versed in archaeology and I didnt know about this discovery before watching this film. I think that might be the case for many other people but the great thing about The Dig is that its primarily a character-driven drama and one that uses emotional intrigue to bring you closer to the story at hand and allow you to appreciate its importance.One element where the film does seem to falter is in its use of the historical backdrop of the lead-up to World War II. Set in the summer months of 1939 before the outbreak of war there are sporadic references to the coming conflict through the first two acts of the movie but they dont seem to bear much relevance to this story about an archaeological find.However the film slowly begins to unveil how the historical context plays into its characters personal lives and the fate of the dig itself with dramatic focus shifting significantly in the final act but just at the right point that the sudden arrival of the war into everyday life feels just like what it would have been like to experience it first-hand taking over everything seemingly normal in an instant.As a result while the historical backdrop seems almost contrived at first it really comes good as the film progresses another demonstration of how the patience of The Dig really plays into its hands throughout.,8.0,1908
ceyda1811, A Real Story,There is a lot I can say about this film but Ill keep it short.If you love simple stories being told in a beautiful and clear manner and if you like Archaeology then this is the film for you. All of the actors have done a wonderful job.,8.0,1909
robertasmith," A well written, acted and directed story",So rare to watch a wonderfully gentle but poignant film. It tugs at the emotions as it tells a largely true. Some liberties are taken with the truth but largely accurate. The real story of Peggy Piggott is fascinating and worth a film in itself. However the real stars of the story are Edith Pretty and Basil Brown portrayed brilliantly by Mulligan and Fiennes. One small criticism is that Carey Mulligan is too young for the part but she carries it off superbly and the performance by Ralph Fiennes is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is superb and the backdrop of imminent war is ever present throughout the film. I have visited Sutton Hoo a number of times and studied the excavation and I still marvel at the work Basil Brown did. As an archaeologist myself I can say his work even by todays standards was of the highest order. Many of the academic archaeologists before and after WW2 were useless when it came to excavation and recording it. Basil Brown did everything right and it is fantastic he is at last getting the credit he deserved and that Edith Pretty wanted for him. It is to the great shame of the academic establishment it has taken so long. The film portrays this extremely well.,8.0,1910
miclarke," Well acted, but.....","Some nice performances here and the set-up for a great narrative about archaeology in pre-war Britain and the role that regular citizens played in scientific exploration but something goes awry along the way. The second half of the film focuses on several plotlines that simply did not even exist in the first half of the movie. Something was clearly done here after the first draft of the screenplay. Were sections cut? Were characters added to ""spice it up""? We may never know but the final product feels awkward though its no fault of the cast here.",6.0,1911
johnbirch-2, Beautiful film that took me by surprise it is so good,"This is a superb film that I could watch again and again.Ive been to see the Sutton Hoo treasures many times and have seen the story told on TV from Blue Peter to Horizon so I was looking forward to this... but also slightly worried about it. Films on subjects like this can be either dry or trivial or triumphalist or worthy or just bad.But from the first scenes this film is beautiful. These is no other word. The outdoor scenes (and much of it is outdoors) is just breathtakingly gorgeous at times. This is Suffolk and wow does it look good. If anyone has seen the BBC series ""The Detectorists"" they will get the idea. It captures the big skies of East Anglia so well sun through the early morning mists or even after the rain like works of art. The stage on which the action is set is sumptuous.As for the action - its just so good. Almost dreamlike at times - I found myself thinking of ""The Go-Between"" (also set in Suffolk of course!) with dialogue over the top of action that is not taking place at quite the same time. Hard to describe but its like memories.Some of the film is a shade predictable - the small enthusiast verses the big guy the mismatched couple and a possible tragic love story the childs eye view at times the repressed sexuality of the period - its all there. But it is so well done.The only downside is that this film - this photography - deserves the big screen but most people will now see it on the small. This is such a shame. Its deserved so much more.",10.0,1912
robinalers, A story about nothing,"Ralph Fiennes plays the character beautifully and carries the movie for the first half. Alas not enough to make it interesting.While the start is promising and portrays Basils (Ralph Fiennes) passion and great work halfway through the movie the storyline just switches. What started as an ode to Basils work the importance of the find and Mrs. Prettys trust quickly turned into a story a love story about two characters we hardly care about. Suddenly Basil is nothing more than a sidelined character whos just kind of ""there"". Like the makers of the movie just decided to make a completely different film halfway through.I feel the movie does little more justice to acknowledge Basils work than history has done by not acknowledging it. His importance and find have been overshadowed by a random love story weve all seen before in many other movies and to have sidelined the archeological find and Basils importance for some cheap love story feels wrong.",5.0,1913
Jimmycakes, There was no need for the distracting love triangle.,"I was excited to see a film that portrays 1930s England and Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan are proven actors that bring a unique presence to their films. Archeology might be a tough sell for the premise of a film and it was these actors that drew me in. The first half gets it so right its just about the time period and characters digging while becoming excited as they unearth the past its rather simple yet these actors have no trouble keeping you interested. In fact it was refreshing to see English people presented on screen becoming excited over finding evidence of their ancestors and past to this ancient land given the current hostile attitude towards the English and Celtic peoples by particular political groups and media companies who like to remind us we have little culture and heritage.Then suddenly its as if the writers thought viewers would become bored and in comes a new character a rather modern-behaving ""liberated"" female with her controlling husband inserted into the plot to remind us how women should really behave in the current age as if we needed reminding. The key characters become background noise and you have this love triangle develop the film takes on a different purpose Id rather see more character development between the man who discovered the relics and the museum trying to take credit from the little man.",6.0,1914

jacoalda, Out of focus and boring,This movie started out well enough with amazing performances by Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan but unfortunately it gets bogged down by the introduction of various characters and unnecessary and excessive focus on their relationships.The relationships from those new characters felt like they lacked proper character development impact and were completely irrelevant to the dig and what was discovered.Also the discovery itself ended up being very disappointing and felt like it didnt need a movie made about it at all.It would have been better if this movie focused much more on the relationship of Edith and Basil with everyone else to the side and the impact of the discovery on their lives rather than the focus being all over the place with several others and their boring relationships.,4.0,1916

wcbagley-90802, It always comes down to politics,I enjoyed this movie even if the actual find is a backdrop and barely mentioned.

azizsalhi-56473," Drama,War,And Relationships",This is a very good movie..if you see the picture from the outside youll say its a story about an Archeologist and his historically important excavation..but if you dig deeper youll find a lot of potential in what the movie is trying to tell you.The relationships between us and the people we lovethe people we dont even know..heck between people in general and how its important to a human being..but that comes with a misunderstandings and conflicts and this happening in a time of war and how that is affecting them..all this has been told in an amazing dramatic way of Brasil Brown who discovered and excavated one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time of course with that being the main story.The acting by Carey Mulligan was magnificent and Ralph Fiennes was the one for this role and their performance was the outstanding thing in the whole movie.Another thing was good is the editing..theyve done a tremendous job and it was really worth the effort to come up with something like this.Although sometimes there are some side stories that youll find yourself not that interested in them too muchand the storytelling could seem very slow at some points..also theres ups and downs like any other movie.Overall great movieworth watching and i suggest you to see it.,7.0,1920

It was overwhelmed with distractions and was not successful.Word to the wise: tell the true story not all the other stories that screenwriters imagine must have been going on at the same time.The story of Mr. Brown and Mrs. Pretty and the discovery should not have been buried under all of the other stories that had nothing to do with the discovery.Disappointing.,4.0,1923
sng-patterson, A great story that needed a better script,The film is packed with acting talent - as an audience member you can almost see the rivets popping as they go for that Award...but oh dear. The overall experience is far below expectations because there is so little explanation of the importance of the find. The implications of what they found literally changed history.Who cares if Lily James character has an affair? It is made painfully obvious why. She plays a character who was Britainss best archaeologist: you wouldnt know it from this storyline.So much more could have been explained and we would have loved it. I think they bent time to make Basil (Ralph Fiennes) look heroic but I am not wholly convinced even after this propaganda. Yes the British Museum are bullies...but thank goodness Britain has this world class institution.,3.0,1924
RamseyReviews1," Not a ""hole"" lot to like. Good acting but the story just wasn't interesting enough.",5/10 StarsThey tried to dress this movie up with world war 2 droplets but in the end it bombed. A story about a man and his hole just wasnt entertaining enough for me. Odd sequences of dialogue between characters while the characters were doing mundane things. Almost felt like the movie was just glitching at times.I found myself more interested in the start of world war 2 then I did the dig. Probably because after the first 45 minutes or so it seemed like they were pretty much done with the project and forgot that the movie had another 75 minutes of runtime left.The Dig is a previously untold real life story of an excavator (Basil Brown played by Ralph Fiennes) who is hired by a wealthy widow (Edith Pretty played by Carey Mulligan) dying of cancer to dig up her land in hopes of discovering something historic before World War 2 shuts the country and project down.Id say the biggest problem with this movie was they didnt make the dig itself important enough to the plot. There was little suspense nor was there much build up behind the story. The writers didnt do a good enough job describing why this dig was so important to the characters involved or history in general. They got caught in between making this movie about Basil Brown whos credit for his discovery was lost in history and Edith Pretty who was dying from cancer and wanted to leave behind a legacy for her son and family to be remembered by and the historical importance of the actual findings from the dig itself. They should have picked a lane and drove everything else around it.I did like the acting by the two main characters Mr. Brown and Mrs. Pretty. They both were very intriguing characters in their own right. I just wish I could have had a little bit more from them and less from the side story love affair between 2 randoms that oddly enter the film halfway.I liked the soundtrack and the shots of this small town in England. I liked the aura they were building up as they incorporated scenes of England preparing to fight World War 2. Wish they would have played that urgency up more though. The impending warn in combination with the fact that you now have a character in Brown desperate to make a name for himself with limited time to finish what will end up being the biggest archaeological dig of his life who desperately needs the support and encouragement of a women in Pretty whos health is quickly deteriorating should have made for a good movie. And even though I think they executed it poorly I still think The Dig wasnt half bad. Has its moments especially within that first hour that I enjoyed.Overall I think this movie can be skipped but if you watch it until the end you probably wont be as disappointed as my review will lead you to believe. It will have its moments with the well acted characters. However youll leave it wondering why they didnt execute the story better and probably find yourself to be just down right uninterested in what they did show.,5.0,1925
batfangruskin, I was looking forward to this movie very much,I was very much looking forward to this movie. The prospect of a film based on the discovery of Sutton Hoo starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan sounds like the perfect combination. And it starts out promisingly with wonderfully rich period detail and stunning scenery. It becomes clear at once that this is a movie for the patient viewer with its deliberate English dramatic pacing. Where it began to fall short for me is when it became apparent that there was going to be very little done with the fact that Sutton Hoo is perhaps the most significant archaeological site in Britain and its discovery and what was learned from it is an amazing tale. Some of that could have been woven into the narrative just a bit. Otherwise there was very little interpretive value in the film and while it is a drama the stories of the main characters which are told with a bit of artistic license are not very compelling or interesting. The side plots of minor characters even less so. The magnitude of the discovery to me was not successfully conveyed in this movie which is a shame. In the end it is a good British period drama with solid acting adequate writing high production values and beautiful cinematography that just never quite gets to the point it should and could have. For folks who are not fans of British slow burn television it will be mind-numbingly boring.,6.0,1926

Whoopz, I'm digging it!,The movie was a bit of a culture shock for me. In Denmark we have similar mounds to the one being dug in the movie. Theyre often left untouched as a form for respect to the dead. Whether its a recent law I dont know - but archeological finds in Denmark belong to the state. Always. Its actually illegal to not report findings to a museum because its a national treasure you *technically* dont own it even if its on your land.I enjoy the movie I thought the storytelling was great. The fact that it was based on real events made it even greater. Im digging it!,8.0,1928

pjkend-11719, It's not really about archaeology,The Dig is not really about archaeology; rather it serves as a backdrop for a quiet and poignant exploration of mortality and legacy at the turn of the second World War. However the ultimate tragedy of the characters and the looming threat of a war in which we know thousands died overshadows any hope that can be gleaned from Basil Browns insistence that we live on and were part of something continuous. By the end of the film it seems Edith Pretty was right in saying We die and we decay.The subtle intelligent performances from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan and stunning cinematography from Mike Eley of familiar countryside made this film. Archie Barnes (who played Robert Pretty) also put in an impressive performance; his face is one I expect to see in British film in the coming years.What made this movie good when it could have been great was mostly down to a poor unoriginal story decision. The romantic subplot was completely unnecessary and felt chiselled in only adding runtime and pushing the balance of pacing to too slow. Some editing decisions were also not wholly effective choosing to replace shots of dialogue acting I should like to have seen with wider shots of the characters and landscape while the dialogue played under these.This may seem like a more negative review but this film really touched me. We all fail (Basil Brown) will stick with me as the hard but nonetheless comforting lesson of The Dig.,7.0,1931
schmidt-timothy, Over-rated,"First the good. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Finnes are both terrific. The stars are for them. They are two enormously talented actors. However the material meanders. Its very much a run of the mill BBC pot boiler of the kind that Miramax trotted out twice a month in the early 90s with very little to get you excited. The creatives seemed to have picked that up halfway through the script so they added a completely inconsequential love triangle amongst the co-stars and saddled poor Lily James with some terrible situations and silly dialogue. Ben Chaplin and Lily James picking out sleeping arrangements sent me to the fridge for sustenance to bare me through the last 45 minutes. The stakes of the find at the center of the ""action"" are that Anglo Saxon civilization had attained cultural heights in Ipswich much earlier than previously known. That seems to be totally irrelevant to the protagonists. Moments of consequence generally when Careys characters take on the cultural establishment mostly happen off screen. (Ran out of money? Ended up on the cutting room floor?) If the characters the writers and the director dont care about the stakes why should I?",3.0,1932
johnmwpartington, Disappointingly Dull,This should have been a fascinating story about how the Sutton Hoo treasures were uncovered and the politics in society and the museum world at the time.

ian_d_hoare, Brought to you by the Netflix marketing department,Considering the potential of the source material the classy cast the accomplished writer and the skilful cinematographer this is a dreadful mess of a film. Packed with cliched sentimental fantasies about rural England between the wars; unfocused with an irrelevant and historically fake romantic subplot tacked on as a crowd-pleasing afterthought; drearily paced ; low in energy; stultifyingly middle-class and devoid of any detectable purpose beyond a purely commercial one.. In places it is laughably bad. You can safely give it a miss in spite of so many positive reviews. I am surprised that the brilliant Carey Mulligan is this desperate for cash.,2.0,1937

Ok it focused on relationships with the dig as a backdrop....but still .

Red-125, They couldn't just trust the real story.,The Dig (2021) was directed by Simon Stone. It stars Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty. Mrs. Pretty is a widow who lives on a large estate. She is convinced that theres something of archeological significance on her property. She employ Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to excavate one of the burial mounds. Brown is a skilled and experienced excavator but he has no formal academic training. The result of his efforts can now be seen in the British Museum.This could have been a great movie if director Stone had just worked with what actually happened. Naturally staff of the local museum wanted to direct the excavation as did staff of the British museum. There was an inquest to decide the ownership of the find. World War II was (literally) about to begin. A perfect 90-minute movie. However it ended up being a less-than-perfect 105 minute movie.Thats because director Stone brings in a (fictitious) cousin of Mrs. Pretty and a beautiful young female archeologist married to a stodgy  unromantic male archeologist. (Guess where that goes?) The inquest--an absolutely essential scene about who owns the find--is botched. You have to work backwards to figure out what happened. Worst of all you never see the dramatic results of the excavation. You can see them in the British Museum or online or on a postcard. However you dont see them in the movie. (Maybe the British Museum didnt like the movie and refused to give permission.)All in all what could have been an excellent movie turned out to be pretty good movie. Its worth seeing as long as you dont expect great things. It works well on the small screen. The Dig has a pretty good rating of 7.3. I agreed and rated it 7.,7.0,1940
philipjheil, Could Have Been So Much Better....,As if the true story wasnt good enough they have to drag it out with a sub plot about an archeologist who is obviously gay and his poor sex starved wife.So much of interest here.....

mackks, Beautiful and worth a watch!,This film was visually beautiful with a rather simple but very moving story. Also had some great underlying themes that stick with you. The acting was incredibly good too. Just when the story started slowing a bit new characters were introduced and drew me right back in.I particularly enjoyed Lily James character and the job she did to portray her. Its a smaller part but adds a lot to the film.It was a treat to see on the big screen if you can find one but otherwise definitely should be on your list to stream on Netflix (if not twice at least once)!,10.0,1942
fralmond-91498, Two plots in one has a disappointing result,Starts off very well focussing on the dig itself. About halfway through new characters and plot thrusts are introduced which turn the original narrative into a melodramatic yawn.Since this sharp left turn involves the introduction of female issues and a new female character who enjoys considerable face-time and who makes critical discoveries and insights perhaps it was thought that insufficient attention had been paid to the recent mandate regarding empowering female characters in film.For me this was an unwelcome imposition.,2.0,1943

douglasp, Entertaining enough but very silly,I was ready to sit down to a slower-paced character driven movie and that is more or less  what was delivered.The film goes on for about an hour with two main characters. Then suddenly a bunch more characters are added including a young married couple in which the husband is a closeted gay man. Then we learn the wife who starts chasing after the cousin of the lead protagonist lost her father to drowning. And her father had some other tragic ailment too. Then an RAF pilot in training tragically crashes in the river that goes right by the property and the cousin takes his gilly weed and dives in but the pilot is dead. And as the ancient artifact is dug up the lead protagonist named Edith tragically comes down with a fatal case of acid reflux.Then they all get together for a party at the penultimate end.Then WWII breaks out at the final end.Great performances with a script that plays loose with the facts. As if facts matter in current year. And yet that was the whole point of Ralph Feinnes digging stuff up so people could know their past and where they came from.If you like slow-paced character driven stories and dont mind being lied to this movie may be for you.,6.0,1946
nickburman, A nice nap.,Being from Suffolk I thought this would be an interesting story about Sutton Hoo. I love long slow films (There Will Be Blood for example) but The Dig just didnt have enough content to make it worth the stay. In 2 hours they dig a mound find treasure (we get a glimpse of a couple of golden unidentified objects) and give it to the museum. Thats it. I suppose the pathetically weak romantic subplot involving two minor characters was an attempt to add momentum. The other main draw was apparently the dialect coach who helped Fiennes. Great.If you want scenery go for a drive. If you want to know anything about Sutton Hoo visit Wikipedia. If you want romance watch Bridges of Maddison Country (if you must). Otherwise youll learn nothing and experience little but hopefully have a nice nap with The Dig.Even the title is dull.,2.0,1947
bastille-852-731547, Mulligan and Fiennes excel in well-crafted drama,Im a big fan of Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes as both of them are remarkable actors who are able to uniquely infuse character development and range into any role they can play. Needless to say this British drama about an excavation of the Sutton Hoo burial site right as World War II was beginning certainly delivers. The film focuses on two main characters Edith (Carey Mulligan) and Basil (Ralph Fiennes.) Edith is a woman living on the property near the Sutton Hoo reeling from grief yet also thoughtfully determined and autonomous in both her interpersonal and private lives. Basil is a mild-mannered archaeologist helping lead the excavation. Mulligan and Fiennes each portray remarkable emotional cores in their performances and clearly are also able to convey the general sense of fear and uncertainty at the time in the United Kingdom as World War II was beginning through their performances as well as the broader historical context of the story.The cinematography of rural England is absolutely outstanding with superb lighting and wide shots. With a delightfully simple aesthetic and a stirring score these aesthetic qualities combined with gripping performances and well-detailed historical context create a uniquely powerful impact on the viewing experience. All of the characters are also very well-developed through the calmly understated yet deeply sophisticated writing and a clear sense of purpose is present in all of them. The tensions between Edith and several individuals representing cultural institutions such as the British Museum and Ipswich about exactly what to do or where to send the discoveries from the excavation are also very gripping creating an additional layer of depth to the story. Ultimately what is so unique about this film is that it is simple and elegant on some levels but powerful and layered on other levels. Its ultimate meanings on the significance of culture history and collective sacrifice will be read differently from viewer to viewer; nonetheless this a very powerful and well-made drama that clearly succeeds as both a character acting piece and a potent historical study. Gladly recommended. 8/10,8.0,1948

Steelfram, Mostly well acted but badly written and directed. High reviews reveal how low expectations of audience are.,Started very well I was interested in the story of discovery. But this is a poorly written story beneath the quality of the actors in the film. The pace is too slow after the beginning character development. Well acted except for the lame and vastly overdramatized social message inserted as the film goes on with Lily James character and her husband. Had the story concentrated on the history and the archaeological importance as well as how the basic characters involved it dealt with those issues it could have been good. As soon as the obviously politically pandering sexual element enters the film it becomes aggravating and foolish. The relationships that are affected by this are not believable cheesy unbelievably melodramatic and the chemistry is just not there. I wish people could just write a story without inserting social and political propaganda and messages. Such a shame it could have been good.,3.0,1954
hellohimaank, One of the finest drama movies by Netflix,Whats so good about it?Carey and Ralph- The way they commit to their characters is splendid. There is no emotional extravaganza. the simple and genuine acting is impeccable.Balance- first half focuses on the real dig and the second half is about the people behind this dig. Such a fine balance.Monica as Ralphs wife has a limited but very strong supporting role that I loved it.The ending- sply when the kid is expressing his anger and that long shot when the credit roles...Now thats so cinematic.Whats not so good about it?Slow pace- Such simple and quiet stories can only be enjoyed when you go slow so it may test your patience.Romance- between the young characters was unnecessary and I wanted the makers to spend more time on central characters.In the end The Dig is a pathbreaking movie with such vivid acting.

tigerfish50, Digging for Depth,Based on actual events with World War 2 looming on the horizon theres much to admire in The Dig - acting and cinematography in particular. The opening sequence tells how a widow commissions a local working class archeology enthusiast called Basil Brown to excavate several mysterious mounds on her property. Sadly the film short-changes the achievements of this accomplished amateur just as self-interested academics had done seventy years beforehand.After some significant artifacts are unearthed the narrative subsequently shows how a pompous bigwig from Londons British Museum arrives to muscle Brown out of the projects driving seat. A collection of colorful characters engaged in various intrigues while making momentous discoveries should have provided more than enough dramatic interest. Unfortunately the screenwriters appeared unable to find sufficient substance in the archeological affairs to sustain a feature film - and invented a tepid romance to flesh out the proceedings. This minor sub-plot provides little more than distraction and the story loses its way. If the script had probed a little deeper into the core material complemented by a background of the beautiful East Anglian scenery an impending worldwide catastrophe and ancient mysteries the result would have surely been far more memorable.,6.0,1958

wheeelertron, 5/10 A Worthy But Misguided Dig Ends Up Shallow,The potential here for an educational and worthy tribute to the key players of the 1939 excavation of Sutton Hoo has been somewhat squandered by mid-production rejigging and the addition of parallel romantic storylines and refocus away from the central story of a landowner and her hired assistants digging for treasure and finding it against the clock partially in battle with the archeological establishment and with her young son looking on with fascination all set under the wide and beautifully shot Suffolk skies...why was that not enough?Buffinis script is sharp and the acting of high quality especially Fiennes who plays his character with significant depth intrigue and an apparent impeccable accent and as the cinematography and gentle score gained momentum I was even almost able to forgive a moment of difficult-to-believe drama early on as I settled in to learn more about these characters and what they were about to unearth only to have them sidelined by a number of other narrative threads that began to dominate the second half leaving the original focus of the film neglected its conclusion rushed and much detail lost (or possibly even cut as I suspect studio interference in an attempt to make the film more mainstream/easily-marketed)The result is to some extent an unsatisfactory narrative mess which along with other production problems goes some way towards ruining a project that still manages to achieve significant merit interest and delight and Im sure will be enjoyed by a wide audience hopefully eventually in a proper cinematic release (and possibly with as I argue for here a writer-and-director-led recut!)ðŸŽŸ,5.0,1963
ninjawaiter, Half a Good Film followed by Half a Mess,"What happened to this film halfway through? Did the writers run out of story? It doesnt seem so. It seems like they were just on the verge of really diving into the discovery itself and (critically) why it was so gosh darned important and then suddenly the story was hijacked by terrorists or something. How else to explain the sudden shift?Instead of paying off all that buildup in digging (literally the name of the film) and character development from the first half were suddenly saddled with a whole new cast of characters who are almost completely irrelevant to the story but whose personal relationships suddenly take over the entire second half of the film pushing the original characters onto the sidelines and derailing the entire effort. Not only are the original characters sidelined but the discovery itself practically becomes an afterthought.Instead were left following a bunch of random jerkweasels down idiotic subplots about adultery (actual) and homosexuality (implied) none of which have even the slightest relevance to the original story or characters. Was this another case of producers putting their grubby little fingers into things and wrecking it all up? I can only speculate.In the end the film earns a ""Eh it passed the time..."" 5 Star rating and that only barely and on account of stellar performances and a good first half that was clearly spoiled by nefarious persons.

digdog-785-717538," incredibly dull and boring (so, realistic)","I absolutely love Ralph Fiennes and consider it a crime he was put in this film.Let me explain why i have such a low opinion of this film.The excavation of Sutton Hoo is one of the most important archeological finds that have ever happened .. in Britain. Mostly because of the amount of precious artefacts recovered. There was no surprise that the Anglo-Saxons populated the area so its not really comparable to any say south-american excavation revolutionizing our understanding of precolombian civilization.Anyway the story is of Basil Brown a ""guy"" who is called in to excavate a whole bunch of burial mounds. These mounds being literal mounds of dirt do not do much in the real of opposing to being dug up and as such the digging goes on as expected. There is one pathetic scene of a cave-in (in a situation where it couldnt actually happen but that is how desperate this film is for attention) but otherwise there is little conflict in this film thats beyond some harsh words at the team table.And you know conflict happens to be one of the major pivotal points of filmmaking. You really *do* need an antagonist in your film if youre gonna have something that the protagonist is struggling against. And a protagonists struggle is what causes the viewer to identify with the protagonist. I am sure that any filmmaker put in charge of several million quids worth of budget knows.So Basil Brown digs the defenseless mounds of earth finds a wooden ship a guy from the British Museum shows up and the end...I would not recommend The Dig. While there are some vaguely interesting attempts at period recreation there is very little else of interest and i dare question why the subject matter was even considered exciting enough for a full-length film in the first place. Did they think Fiennes was going to magically generate a protagonist-antagonist relationship out of thin air?My vote: 5/10 - please look elsewhere for entertainment *even* if you are an archeologist.",5.0,1966

alightinthedarkfilms, A fine show until....,I was really enjoying this in the first half. The acting was first rate down to earth focused and skilled dialogue was also quite realistic. Then...here we go again... the show dissolves in the standard fashionable route preferring PC undertones and diverting the emotional eye away from what was humanly and historically fascinating in the opening act. A clumsy musical score only goes to punctuate this as the film is driven down an abandoned rabbit hole. Why wont you just stop with the emasculation quasi historical snobbery rubbish and allow the romances to shine in what is a fair and solid drama arc. Stop scraping our bones please!Didnt like the talking out of shot either a cheap trick and in my opinion lazy. Directing the actors to speak in the shot and then edit the scene using the best performances is what making a film is. This director appears unsure including in what it is to make a film preferring to copy Fellini or the like. Its almost like two different films in one. If they merged then why not that has been achieved... sadly not here these often under lit sub plot bumped clumsily into each other like two walruss I mean in a painful way.I love Ralph Fiennes in this and many of his films he seems to be one of those rare individuals working in British Film and why does even bother? I mean he must be seriously wealthy by now...still he remains true to his craft and keeps growing as a skilled artist. The thing is If they keep slashing up his films like this over and over I wonder if he will leave us behind I wouldnt blame him one bit.,6.0,1968
AhmedSpielberg99," As a Historical Biography, it's shallow; as a Drama, it's fine",For a movie with so many reviews teetering between either disparaging its direction as a Malick-wannabe or lauding it as having something eloquently poetic about it reminiscent of Terrence Malick I was astonished to find The Dig far from being nearly as divisive as it should be. Theres broad consensus that its a well-acted and well-shot film despite its shortcomings. With only Days of Heaven under my belt (along with quite a few video essays about Malicks style) the only two rights I have here are to agree that: the comparison made here is valid; and the movie is decent at best. With low-angle wide lens shots wind-carried camera coming towards and away from the characters and detaching the dialogue from the on-screen events that let us hover over the characters it may well be argued that the technical approach rendered the film said poetic quality and a dream-like feel that implicitly beseech the viewer to give in to the meditative atmosphere that prevails the scene. Alas this approach seems to be at odds with the most salient plotline in the story or at least the one it was going for at first: the excavation of Sutton Hoo. For the movie neither probes into the remarkable discovery that forms the supposedly overarching thematic plotline nor does it completely ignore it. The story set it up in a fairly compelling way only to ditch it quite early for the dramatic plotlines surrounding the two lead characters leaving the historic achievement merely skimmed over.To be fair Basil Brown and Edith Pretty are multi-layered characters that reveal themselves more and more as the story proceeds and I could tell that from the get-go only looking at Fiennes and Mulligans sorrow-laden countenances that seem to hide (and actually are hiding) secrets underneath the story would later unravel. Still the movie wasnt keen on diving into the characters profiles leaving much to be desired. Then out of nowhere the story shift its focus to another subplot concerning Lily Jamess Peggy Piggott. Its quite possibly the most interesting segment in the story and Lily James really gave one of her most riveting performances to date. Be that as it may this jarring shift from one storyline to another is rather distracting aggravating the movies lack of consistency even further and the fact Mrs. Prettys storyline was sidetracked for no reason makes it all the worse. Thankfully and as the story wraps up the movie finally acquired a discernible identity. The character arcs were mostly tied up gracefully and neatly the technical prowess at its most thriving and the film regained its contemplative tone with a dash of weltschmerz tossed in for effective measure. Despite its blatant inextricably linked issues The Dig is a stunning-looking great film with even greater performances buried inside a rather muddled one.(7/10),7.0,1969

How they treated their servants and staff just like they were only one step above beasts of burden still gets me angry. How they got away with it for so long is beyond me.The storyline is so-so interestwise the discovery of an Anglo-Saxon burial ship that was thought at first to be a Viking ship... Because its Anglo-Saxon it moves back the dates of human occupation at the site and apparently thats very important to arcteryx...... sorry ""archeologist"" intelligentsia.Big deal! They found a Viking ship in a pubs car park close to where I used to live and they didnt make a movie about that. In fact the first time they discovered it they covered it over with blacktop and put some tables and chairs out there.Of course the discovery in this plot only catches the interest of the upper crust the poor peasants are too busy working the fields to be interested.So they have to fatten the story with a tragic illness a backdrop of the second world war breaking out and a tiny bit of gratuitous nudity... dont blink  youll miss it.There is some good acting in it though and some good exploration of the counterplay between the educated professor and the gifted amateur archeologist but its not enough to turn it into a great movie.I like Ralph Fiennes and I like Carey Mulligan but they didnt have a lot to work with.

davidvliet, Oscar worthy...,Ralph Fiennes Should be nominated for an Academy Award for this movie. Hes just remarkable. In fact the movie really should be nominated for Best Picture.Beautifully paced beautifully and acted gorgeously filmed. I thought Lily James was particularly good in this film as well. Actually the whole cast turned in remarkable performances.The movie doesnt strain it feels relaxed and true. Its thrilling to watch things develop. Ill leave it there.,10.0,1974
dartmouth-39013, Gut wrenchingly postured,I can only imagine this is and American vision of the English of the past. The insipid an desiccated presentation of English class differences. People were either stuck up and boring or inarticulate forelock tugging and boring.Creepy cold piano chords accompany the most banal of conversations. as part of a truly deadly score throughout.Ralph Fiennes county accent is full of public school flaws and in portraying a rather self conscious man over egged it so much that I just felt embarrassed for him. .All players wooden through and throughTerrible screenplay.Not a glimmer of humour or self reflexivity in any of these characters which renders them 2 dimensional.Im glad that so many people seemed to enjoy it .What an utter waste of money it would have been otherwise.I was one of the few people I knew who found The English Patient to be an insipid bore and am surprised to find that we have not evolved from this pretentious and silly imagining of the English class system of yore.,3.0,1975
rpvtimcotter, The Dig is two films that should be nowhere near each other.,One is an interesting yet slow drama of an amateur archeologist meeting a woman whos willing to take a chance on him all based on real life events. The other is an appropriate period piece about a young woman finding herself in a loveless marriage with a gay husband in the 1930s a less forgiving age of such thing. On their own they both have merit. Together they make a confused story weaving around the two distinct plots so often that it seems like its forgetting what its about.Its an unfortunate result as both these plots are filled with charismatic writing and carried by phenomenal acting Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes in the former plot and Lily James and Johnny Flynn in the latter.Depending on which story drew you in watching The Dig is like treading water shifting between above water and below. Those shifts can sometimes bring jarringly violent as well giving its audience the wrong kind of realization of just how much of this film is at war with itself. Is it about the glaring classism in the field of science or about love and loss? Is this a character study of people of that era or a story of how learning and honoring the past can bind people in the present?The movie attempts to bridge these gaps by including moments where the two distinct plots and themes intersect but those moments of fleeting and stop short of making the point come across to its full effect.Perhaps the creators of The Dig did not think the nonfictional aspect of the plot centered around the Sutton Hoo excavation were enough to fill an entire film a point to which I agree. Then the question becomes one that a movie-goer should never ask: why make this film at all?,4.0,1976
ianquayle-50789, Nice production values but too long,"Sorry to go against the grain of all the rave reviews here but I thought that although The Dig was beautifully produced and photographed it was dull boring and tedious. It could easily have been edited down to an hour. The movie was saved by the impeccable performance of Ralf Fiennes as Basil Brown with a pretty credible Suffolk accent.SPOILER ALERThe writer clearly needed to pad out what after all is a very simple story with the entirely irrelevant triangular love saga of the frigid relationship between Stuart and Peggy Piggot and the fictional cardboard-cutout character of dashing young Rory Lomax. The Piggots had apparently just come off their honeymoon but clearly had no interest in each other and Peggy eventually fell for Rory. Earlier in the movie Rory who was about to join the RAF had bravely dived into a river to attempt to rescue the pilot of a Spitfire that had crashed into it. Rory appeared to hold his breath for several minutes while extracting the pilots body. This whole side story was irrelevant ill-fitting and distracting from the main plot.Having praised Ralph Fiennes I cannot say the same for Carey Mulligan as my instant reaction on first seeing her on screen was ""Oh there is a young actress trying to portray a character much older than herself"".Being new to Netflix this is the first of their home-grown movies I have watched. I was disappointed at how they could spend so much time and effort to make a movie that looked so good but in its structure and narrative was so disappointing.",4.0,1977

pawebster, Interesting but also dull,"I have never liked the words ""Based on a true story"". Either give us a story as true as can be or just give us a story. Here its a bit like the Railway Children - exciting incidents at intervals. Realising that archeology might seem dull it was decided there should be a couple of dramatic accidents and a love affair neatly spaced through the running time. If only they could really have devoted themselves to transmitting the fascination of the archeology involved. It would have been a big challenge but great if it had come off. (By the way its weird that we are not properly shown the treasure - not even in the end credits.) Instead we have a hefty dose of the dreamy ""last summer before war"" trope admittedly with the odd downpour. Im getting round to saying its a bit boring. The actors: Carey Mulligan is too young but otherwise wonderful (as is the boy playing her son). Ralph Fiennes is excellent. Lily James is wearing oversized modern designer glasses lest we forget that shes a beautiful young actress of the 21st century. Johnny Flynn is too old but gets away with it and really inhabits the period especially in his manner of speech.",7.0,1981

crstuder87," Good all around, though not what I expected","The acting was great. Characters were fully fleshed out and relatable. The story though not riveting explored some of lifes deeper meanings and trials. Very good all around. It did seem like it could have used a few more minutes at the end to wrap things up a little better. Also a little more information and focus on the history of what they found was expected but not delivered. This is less of a history focused movie and more a movie focused on the complexities of human relationships. That said its not a typical love story. It does have various ""love"" stories within it but also focuses on the fact that our time is fleeting and precious so we should consider how and who we spend it with wisely. I came for the history and though I got a full on drama instead I was not disappointed. It was done in a fresh way. One last warning I wouldnt call this a feel good story. It was a bit sad. So save this one for when you are in the right mood for it.",8.0,1986

micpatodo, Could have been better without the side stories,I liked the main plot of the movie but I guess the story was too simple and because of that Netflix decided to include a side story that has nothing to do with the plot.

jwycoff-641-926025, Man finds thing. Museum gets thing.,"And I killed 2 hours that needed killing. And somewhere in the last half the movie turns into a teen drama or something like it.I wont be a total downer though. The Dig has superior acting a great setting/period and an amazing ""based on true events"" story line. Unfortunately after the big reveal around 20 minutes in there just wasnt any more tension or drama. What drama there was felt forced and trite.In the second half the main characters the main plot and the ship all take a backseat to the drummed up love triangle of the ancillary-at-best characters that we care nothing about. This just feels awkward and doesnt really accomplish anything. The plot engine was definitely idled at the half. In the end the museum wins and the girl in the love triangle gets banged among the ruins of an old farmhouse and Ralph is left wondering why he wasted his talents on this experiment. That is all. Enjoy!",6.0,1989
mha-89327, Beautifully Delivered & Unstated Quality British Drama,The Dig is a delicate tale with multiple layers. As is the case with good drama the characters are multiple and varied in in their subtleties and their complexities. Interestingly one of the lead characters is not a sentient being but a meadow in a Suffolk field in England. However this field is no ordinary fallow area of grass it is populated by large mounds - likely ancient burial sites. Thus this movie is innately interwoven with an archeological story of excavation and the potential of wondrous historical discovery.Parallel to this quite prosaic undertaking are several very human and engaging stories of grief tragedy recognition ambition greed and human revelation. These tales are very human delicately explored on the screen through a well written script exposed with a sensitivity not unlike the granular and studied removal of spoil from an archeological dig.There are numerous captivating dramatic portrays not just involving the central protagonists but also in the revelations of the supporting cast as well. A beautifully crafted piece of British drama where almost all cast members are given space of annunciate their role and emphasise their voice and their dynamic characteristics on screen. Humble characters are given the dramatic landscape and opportunity to shine. Thus quiet characters are highlighted in a vibrant silabancy adding to the dramatic ambiance of the production. A most enjoyable experience for this viewer at least for me anyway. Highly recommended.,8.0,1990

mdh-81161, Slow torture,Was quite excited. Loved the Sutton Hoo artefacts from the history books from school but this film killed it.Wow! Fiennes in the lead role. Couldnt go wrong could it?He comes across as lobotomised and the Suffolk accent is ridiculous. You can just imagine him looking in the mirror saying moooorrniiiin over and over and crunching a carrot to get in character.The performances all round are pretty bad and the Lady Penelope character acts about 150 years out of place.Worst of all is the film where almost nothing happens. Enthralling it isnt. Unless you enjoy watching Fiennes put on and take off wellies.It would have been vastly improved by making the artefacts/treasure themselves as the main story and a nuanced and subtle Mr Basil Brown (it didnt help that this alliterative name continually evoked images of Basil Brush! Boom! Boom!) would still have been the central character and hogged the limelight but the iconic helmet etc. were nowhere to be seen.Instead we were left with a seemingly challenged central character and innocuous irrelevant sidekicks (e.g. the wife of Fiennes) who again appeared to be one brick short.Slow torture it were and its a shame as the subject matter could have been handled so much more adroitly.Spielberg or Ridley Scott would have insisted on imagined flashbacks to the burial with CGI. If Ray Winstone could do it in Beowulf!Never mind thet tried in this but failed. Was all a bit too luvvy duvy art housy.,2.0,2008

tabuno, A Solid Period Piece About A Major Archeological Discovery With Interpersonal Emotion,This period piece based on true events depict the discovery and excavation find in Britain just prior to and during the beginning of World War II. The movie depicts an amateur excavator hired by a widow to investigate some mounds of dirt on her property. The set design is well conceived the acting polished and maybe well understated. The relational interactions between the primary characters are fascinating as they do not fall into any of the contrived script contraptions to great effect. A subplot involving a young lady archeologist and her relationship with her husband bordered on being a uninvited distraction but seems to blend acceptably well into the movie as a whole. This movie is both exciting and revealing but in the wet gray weather also exudes a rather somber sad tone throughout.,8.0,2012

packmanproductions, Unearthing An Exceptional Story,A story about an archaeological dig may seem to be a subject of narrow interest to many for a full-length drama. However director Simon Stone weaves a story of depth with many layers uncovered along the way. Carey Mulligan is outstanding as Edith Pretty a widow with a bad heart but with a sense of discovery on her British estate. She employs Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to lead a team excavating the mounds of land to find what treasures lie beneath.Beautiful cinematography adds to this gem as England is on the cusp of war in 1938. Lily James is charming as a woman in a loveless marriage whose future plans are stymied due to the impending conflict with Germany.Bases on a true story The Dig explores the meaning of history and life through past civilizations but also raises the question of what happens to us if anything once our time is up on earth.

anniemarshallster," Anglo Saxon attitudes - class, art and sex in the 1930s",Every word of this film is freighted with meaning as is every image. Theres nothing superficial or redundant. The assembly of events via sound and image is subtly double-edged conveying what is and what might be occasionally teasing audience expectations and presenting alternatives which challenge our preconceptions of what should be.To make a period drama that genuinely conveys how the people probably felt rather than how we would like them to have felt requires emotional and historical insight some innate poetry and a willingness to take risks with audiences levels of empathy and understanding. So a necessary note of appreciation for the direction by Simon Stone the script by Moira Buffini the lighting the camerawork the design (costume and set) and the performances by everyone. There are no small parts in this film. It has been an incremental process of delicate decisions.This film is a meditation about England and the English at a perilous moment in history as much as it is about Sutton Hoo and its treasures. Theres poetry intertwined with myth magic and humour - all underlying the concrete facts. In its conjunction of emotion time and landscape it seems unlike most modern British cinema; one has to hark back to the past to the extraordinary films of Powell and Pressburger in the 1940s especially A CANTERBURY TALE to match this mood style humour sadness and triumph. Clearly I believe The Dig belongs in very special company.This is our current Zeitgeist. It speaks to us now. I anticipate we will still feel as moved by The Dig in another seventy years.,10.0,2019

And its exciting. And well acted.But when they introduce Lily JamesPeggy Piggott the story changes. And as of now I still dont know to what. I like Lily James. I was excited to see her pop up because I didnt realize she was in it. But I still cant find a reason for her character. Other then she was lonely? I was watching a movie about excavating and then I wasnt. Very weird. Her story arc had no bearing on well the story. Then to find out the character she fools around with is fictional. What? So now we know. Someone wanted her in it so they made up a story line. With a guy going to war. Except he wasnt real. So now Im doubly sure her character was disposable.For those who didnt see two different movies like me. I envy you. If they kept on track with the two main characters Basil Brown and Edith Pretty I just know I would have given it ten stars. But sadly seeing a pretty face that has no purpose well has no purpose.Oh wait she did find a little ring or something. SMH,7.0,2022
FlossieCat, An enjoyable film but...,"We watched this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. The contribution that Basil Brown made to archaeology and that particular discovery was emphasised and he was given the credit that academia for some years denied him..In some respects it was a real life event used as an allegory with Britain on the cusp of another terrible war with Germany and with the threat of invasion. Meanwhile in the quiet Suffolk countryside an ancient burial ship is being excavated of another German invader whose people fifteen centuries previously had invaded and conquered the island and who had brought their culture and language ruled the country and given England both its name (Engla land) and its broadly invented identity as an ""Anglo Saxon"" country.We even got a hint of the ""Anglo Saxon"" warrior caste when the body of the young RAF pilot (another warrior) who has crashed and drowned is seen laid out (like a burial) in a small boat and brought to the shore.The photography was glorious with lovely lingering shots taken at dusk and dawn of the countryside and the mounds while the recreation of the ship burial was superb. All in all a slow somewhat Ingmar Bergman-like approach to both dialogue and cinematography which was hugely enjoyable.Now to the buts. Did nine year old Robert really cycle from Woodbridge to Diss (30 miles/49 km) without anyone noticing?Carey Mulligan was too young to be Edith Pretty who would have been 56 in 1939 and Ken Stott was too old to be Charles Phillips who would have been 38 in 1939.The photographs of the excavation were taken by two teachers who were on holiday in the area and Ediths cousin Rory is an invention purely to provide a fictional love interest with ""Peggy"" Piggott whose marriage to Stuart Piggott actually ended in 1956. She went on to pursue her own academic career and in later life was in regular contact with Stuart .Finally why did the screenwriter feel obliged to suggest that Stuart Piggott was gay? As far as I am aware there is no evidence to suggest that he was so why was it introduced?Or is having a token LGBTQ+ and/or a person of colour now de rigueur for all films?",8.0,2023

bhkhannan, More toil than story,"The Dig (2021) **When stuck in a plot hole crime writer Raymond Chandler used to send in a new character with a gun. Simon Shine has employed the same concept minus weaponry. People just keep turning up in the Dig adding very little to the story which in itself setting aside National Trust hype is on the slim side. A sixth-century burial site (thought it does cast new light on the Dark Ages so we are told) is not in the same archeological class as a velociraptor or an Egyptian tomb. Mostly we are misled. For the first third it looks like we are heading for Lady Chatterleys Lover territory with posh lady (Carey Mulligan) eyeing up the digger (Ralph Fiennes) until his wife turns up. Then it looks like its going to be a battle royal between Fiennes and the Establishment but that is headed off.Its 1939 so the Second world War is on its way. Cue the arrival of wannabe pilot (Johnny Flynn). A top archaeologist (Ken Stott) also appears but that doesnt go anywhere either bringing with him Ben Chaplin and Lily James fresh from their honeymoon. James gets the hots for Johnny Flynn and theres just enough time before the credits roll for them to get at it.This is the kind of film that has money to spend on an old WW2 aeroplane or maybe a CGI version of one but not enough for decent sound recording equipment. Most of the time conversations are over the shoulder or in long shot. Its not just words its expressions faces that tell a story and being denied these seems bizarre. It may be an artistic decision some critic thought we were being made to ""dig"" for the story. But its hard enough to work up any enthusiasm without being made to work harder.Ralph Fiennes is excellent a son of the soil self-taught but no shrinking violet either. His scenes with posh ladys son (Archie Barnes) are very touching the young lad having invented a whole world for himself. Carey Mulligan just looks as though shes about to burst into tears probably wondering how she managed to be talked into playing (at age 34) a woman who was actually 56 at the time of the dig and wishing Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett (closer to that age) who were at one point attached had not left her to it.The dig itself is interesting - but only for about five minutes. We know all we need to know about the boring sifting and brushing and digging from other films and we dont learn more from this except how easy it is for a wall to suddenly collapse and nearly kill someone.The most intriguing part of the film came at the end when we discovered that the burial ship dug up was buried for the duration of the war in an Underground station in London. How did they manage that I wondered. Whereas I didnt wonder much about anything else in this film.",3.0,2028
deepfrieddodo, Solid Retelling of a Historical Discovery,The best a film about an archeological dig can be without someone cracking a whip and being chased down a tunnel by a boulder. A superb performance from Ralph Fiennes and a story which is notable without being riveting. The plot is interesting without being overly engaging characters are developed and individual character arcs are intertwined to the overall story well.

alcorcrisan, A thing of beauty...,I have been hesitating whether to give it 9 or 10 stars and perhaps 10 would be closer to the truth were it not for the rather slow first half of the movie. The understatement as an art is what we deal with here and perhaps we should get more opportunities to do so. To be reminded of the fleetingness of life of the importance of a kind word and gesture. The archaelogical dig is a pretext for a clinical examination of human passions and relationships. Enjoy!,10.0,2030

agmoldham," Pleasant enough, but forgettable.",The dig tells the story of Basil Browns (Ralph Fiennes) archaeological dig on Edith Prettys (Carey Mulligan) land. It is a very slowly paced movie and is pleasant enough. There are various tensions and romantic interests throughout the movie as we see if Ediths suspicions are right about what lies beneath the soil. It is one of those movies which is very watchable without you ever really getting enthralled by any of the characters. Im not entirely sure why that is as some of the storylines should carry a lot of emotion. The cast is strong and they all put in reasonable performances. I couldnt shake of the feeling that I should have been more engaged with the characters.,5.0,2033
croco-dopolis, Good cinema. Engaging. Not stupid.,"After watching ""The English Patient"" and ""The Constant Gardener"" I swore I would never watch another movie with Ralph Fiennes again as long as I lived.My girlfriend said she liked it and being snowed in the last few days I figured Id give it a shot.I found this to be surprisingly good cinema. Very well done with good talent great cinematography albeit a somewhat slowly evolving storyline. That however is perfectly in tune with 1939 Britain - bad cooking and all.Im only submitting this review so that those who happen to click on my other reviews dont get the impression that I hate everything - its just that I find most modern cinema poorly written horribly acted and ridiculously childish.This one was made for adults and it is well worth the two hours viewing time.",8.0,2034
leoburnman, Boring film about human relations,"I was very surprised by the high rating of this utterance.You say because Ralph Fiennes. I agree today he is probablythe best actor who manages to play almost any role masterfully from maniac to Lord VoldemortI didnt understand what the author wanted to say with his work. What should I understand after watching this movie how will I become better after seeing this what will the movie can teach me?Is this movie about passionate people ? ""No I didnt see a passion for digging in Carey Mulligan. When she was called to look at the found ship her reaction was about the same as if I would see a promotion for a second free hamburger at McDonalds.There was an attempt to create several hooks that logicallyshould have led to the development of the plot. But for some reason the director or screenwriter did not develop this. It can be seen that the authors of the film have a bad idea of what really burning people look like who are burning with ideas to find something new.The result was a shallow and sometimes not logical movie I do not feel sorry for any of the characters.This is a slow non-eventful boring film about human relations against the background of archaeological excavations in which there are attractive landscapes pleasant-looking clothes rather boring dialogues.",5.0,2035
Fatemeh_Hadi, An Inspiring Soothing Real Story,"It is one of those films that are soothing for me to watch. Knowing characters like Edith existed (and continue to exist) turns on a light. She tells excavator Basil Brown that she ""feels"" something lays beneath the mounds on her property. Of course she is an experienced archeologist and of course as Daniel Kahneman says she has the ""expert intuition"" but she says she feels nonetheless. She pursued this undertaking not only because as an archeologist she could recognize the patterns but also because she was compelled by her inner forces to try and create something very much worth experiencing and not just for herself. As the story progresses she finds out she is terminally ill. She draws strength from each to face the other and manages to make such harmonious realizations of both endeavors. It reminded me of a scene in which Harry (in Harry Potter stories) abandoning all apparent logic goes to see Hagrid in his shed. I dont recall in what context this happens but I do remember as a result of this act everyone (that mattered) came to a better understanding of the situation. It doesnt seem like a significant scene but it had stayed with me I think because it shows how beautiful it can be if we sometimes embody something more than mere common wisdom.In a scene Mr. Browns wife trying to reassure him of his work reminds him of some of his own words. She remarks archeology is not about the past nor it is about the present but that it is about the future so that future generations know what came before them know their forefathers. Because of their findings it became clear that Anglo Saxons were cultured people that had rich rituals art and trade.After extracting the treasure and after all the excitements are over Mr. Brown returns to the cite to carefully bury back the ship or more precisely the impressions of the ship giving it the respect it deserved. Not only by his conviction he shed some light to the lives of the people who had lived more than thirteen centers before in the land but also he had the capacity to pay respect to the people who were gone eons before.And all of this happened while some people were thinking the best thing could be done was waging a war against humanity and well the rest were making preparations for defense.One thing Id like to point out is I think a typical child does not respond to the pain of that magnitude like how Ediths son is portrayed. A childs response would be more like Conor in A Monster Calls. Now that Ive mentioned this I have to confess I adore both Carey Mulligan and Felicity Jones. So you better take my review with this knowledge ;)",10.0,2036
eddie_baggins, An enjoyable Netflix drama that loses momentum as it goes,Shining a light on the little known story behind the important discovery of ancient Anglo-Saxon artefacts at the Sutton Hoo dig site in England during the late 1930s as war threatened to rage on around the peaceful country Netflixs latest prestige drama is the very definition of an easy watch movie that is one the whole family will be able to enjoy.At times Australian director Simon Stones film threatens to be something more than this for the first 30 to 40 minutes the tale of Ralph Fiennes archaeologist Basil Browns work on Carey Mulligans widow Edith Prettys farm land that is based off a hunch she has about the mysterious mounds that are located on her property is one that will grip you in its English countryside beauty and thrill of Browns early digging on the site but the film sadly starts to lose momentum and focus from here on out as other characters join the fray and the tales focus has awkward shifts that never feel totally earned.Looking to cast a wide net on on those involved with the Sutton Hoo site excavation the initial intrigue around the job at hand and Brown and Prettys friendship and working relationship is a strong component of the early stages of Stones film but when the likes of Johnny Flynns wannabe pilot/photographer Rory and Ben Chaplin and Lily James Mr and Mrs Piggott enter the picture it feels as though Stone and the film lose themselves to subplots and dalliances that vary in their intrigue levels for viewers and The Dig starts to become less about its titular task and more about dramatics that dont add a whole lot of engagement to what was at one stage a focused and gripping true life tale.An element that remains strong throughout The Dig is a collection of strong performances from its talented cast with Ralph Fiennes getting his best role in sometime here as the socially inept Brown while Mulligan is her typically assured self as the ailing Edith.Both performers are reasons why The Dig is so gripping in its initial phases and its a shame they begin to get less screen time together and overall when the likes of Flynn Chaplin and James roll into the frame. Its not that these performers are in any way bad its just by the time they arrive we as an audience have already grown attached to the journeys of Brown and Pretty and their respective drive to uncover what could be one of Englands most noteworthy cultural discoveries and find meaning in their lives after respective failures disappointments and heartbreak.Final Say -A film that is beautiful to look at and one that will grip you early with its characters and dirt covered subject matter The Dig is a solid Netflix prestige offering that suffers from a lack of focus and too many plot strands as it progresses along its merry way.3 tarps out of 5,6.0,2037
rup_74, A Film of Two Halves,"A movie that focuses on pre-war archaeological discovery is currently newsworthy with ""The Dig"" being released on Netflix on the 40th anniversary of the first installment of Indiana Jones rollicking adventures; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Whilst Indiana Jones is pure fiction and action oriented ""The Dig"" is a romantic drama that meanders from the outset. Having said that the key events surrounding the excavation of an Anglo Saxon treasure ship are loosely based on true events. A wealthy widow played by Carey Mulligan permits an experienced amateur archaeologist (Ralph Fiennes) to investigate what lurks beneath the mysterious hillocks that frequent her windswept coastal Suffolk estate.The film begins beautifully with the countryside offering a dreamy backdrop to the main characters burgeoning friendship and their respective plights. The viewer is transported back in time and becomes a participant in the hunt to find hidden treasures. The camera work poetically caresses the senses and its undoubtedly a movie that demands a spare plot so the viewer can soak up the atmosphere and fully appreciate the masterclass performances from the two leads.This initially well rounded art house film gradually morphs into a more wishy washy affair with a group of newly introduced characters stealing the lead actors thunder halfway through. Another recent slow burning visual piece - ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019) flourished by having unhindered character development and by remaining true to its inherent nature from start to finish. It (seemingly) wasnt made first and foremost as a box office venture like material made for Netflix often is. A decision was probably made (in The Dig) to shift gears from its established tempo so as to grab the attention of the kind of viewer who might be nodding off or who prefers a bit more sex appeal. As a result - its a movie of two halves. 6/10 overall",6.0,2038
keywester-05337, Honest review from an actual grown adult,"The Dig is a great ""Slow Burn"" movie great for evening entertainment. You truly care about the characters (Especially Lily James). You care about the plot and although there are no crazy chase scenes or explosions theres plenty of drama. Lily James is great as usual and pretty darn cute as usual.Being based on actual events makes it even better and the film location is awe inspiring. Def worth a watch.",7.0,2039
ozjosh03," Beautifully crafted, classy entertainment",The Dig will probably be dismissed by some as old-fashioned and middlebrow. But this film lifted my spirits just by being an elegantly-crafted intelligent and engaging story. Its skilfully directed with outstanding performances by Fiennes and Mulligan and the cinematography is exceptional. The film also shines a light on the overlooked heroes behind a significant archeological find. In a year where the likely Oscar contenders include the insufferably pretentious and pointless Mank and a slew of poor adaptations of stage plays (The Prom Ma Raineys Black Bottom) a film like The Dig restores your faith in real moviemaking.,8.0,2040

ChungMo," Two movies in one - one unusual and interesting, the other trite and predictable.","A rather unusual story of an ""excavator"" (really an archeologist would hasnt gone thru formal training) and an ailing widow with a young boy gets an excellent treatment from the direction cinematography and the actors until halfway thru when a new set of characters get introduced and the film shifts gears to a very predictable romance between a young woman married to a stuffy academic and an about to be enlisted strapping young man. The married couple actually makes no dramatic sense as we are not given any backstory as to how this marriage happened or how the wife only now figures out whats wrong.Now if somehow the original characters were integral to this second story it would have been different but it like we are watching another movie that was filmed next door and the actors from the first were asked to come in and be extras. But I must give kudos to a film that makes watching people brushing dirt of of ancient artifacts interesting.",5.0,2043
mckaymalcolm, Great poignant movie but....,Beautifully acted with pathos intellect and emotion.I do feel there was one major flaw- the beauty of the horde is never really fully shown to the viewer.Ive seen it at the British Museum several times- but most viewers wont have and the impact of this find may be lost on them. The Sutton Hoo helmet is one of the most iconic finds in the history of archeology- and it doesnt feature.Its like making a movie about Howard Carter and not showing the golden burial mask of Tutankhamen - crazy.Some may argue this movie is entirely about the characters - fine but I desperately wanted to feel the moment when these beautiful artifacts were held and seen for the first time and it didnt truly deliver on that point.,8.0,2044
W011y4m5, Lovely.,"God damn what a beautiful movie.""The Dig"" is a masterclass in powerful filmmaking - borne from Moira Buffinis brilliantly written screenplay gifting actors with sumptuously layered characters to play who mindfully convey so much of the suggested subtext on the page in the delicate nuances of their performances. Director Simon Stone also impressively crafts phenomenally edited sequences (thank you Jon Harris) to capitalise off of these impactful moments of dramatic tension exacerbating the meticulously placed silences throughout - where the unspoken words deafen audiences with their intentional presence - until the quality of the material present in the script is elevated even further as a result. Commendation is therefore owed to the outstanding sound designers - who really bring their A game here - & additionally to cinematographer Mike Eley who genuinely astonishes with his gorgeous camera work / uses of natural light gently immersing audiences in to the story with handheld shots that feel warm grounded & hopeful - akin to Terrence Malicks 1978 classic ""Days of Heaven"".Cant recommend it highly enough. This is a gem of a film that deserves appreciation.",8.0,2045

sarcasm_for_free, I didn't 'dig' it.,The Dig commits the most unpardonable sin a movie could and that is the fact that its boring. All the nice performances good cinematography and spot-on period detail in the world cant change the dull script and I ended up making jokes about the ongoing staidness to my friend just to survive the runtime.The event that it didnt impress me shouldnt come as much surprise after all this movie arrives hot-on-the-heels of overrated tripe like Normal People and Bridgerton. At least this is just a movie only two hours youll never get back. The others are full-blown TV series which go on for much longer. Give the next episode a try if I hated the first? Not on your nelly. Life is too short.What else can I say about it? A bunch of uninteresting adults and an unbelievably annoying kid potter around a large field talking nonsense while excavating for a large ship. If you can stand the company of these bores for a period of more than a few minutes then good luck to you. I found their inconsequential lives utterly tedious and the few moments where things threatened to get intriguing were soon snuffed out by more verbal guff and long strolls in the country. Yawn.About halfway through as if realising the complete monotony of what they were serving us up they introduce a new couple of characters... a sexually-starved bride and her nebbish husband who kind of take over the movie. Neither of these unexpected additions contributes anything of note to the story besides more dreary padding.Basically I didnt give a hoot about any of these prosaic individuals no matter how much cheap melodrama they threw at us (especially late on). It all adds up to a real snooze fest that unless youre a sufferer of acute insomnia Id bail out while I have the chance. 4/10,4.0,2052

The legal challenge over the ownership was glossed over.Instead the film attempts to focus on some very weak relationships.To me a good movie engages you. It makes you laugh it makes you cry.

Its as British as you can get. A moving life affirming film thst plays to all its strengths and doesnt try to be anything it isnt but succeeds in everything that it is. The cinematography is gorgeous with wide beautiful landscapes of rural Suffolk countryside through various weather conditions. The acting is riveting and utterly authentic and the chemistry between all performers believable and holds your eyes and ears on the screen.With strong links and having lived in Norfolk for 10 years seeing the Suffolk accent absolutely nailed perfectly by Ralph F was a joy. The soundtrack was perfect and added everything it needed to and never caused a distraction to what was on screen.

amfriedland47, A story for the ages,"Others will review the acting direction costumes and cinematography all of which are excellent. To me however this film is distinguished by its slow revelation of the human spirit in the context of the slow motion of history. The mounds hid treasures unknown for over a thousand years. The ""excavator"" - the real hero of the story - is an under appreciated genius whose work is quickly commandeered by the representatives of formal society. The owner seems to be just another wealthy heiress until you learn the tragedy of her widowhood and her frail health. And the minor character of the excavators wife is first seen as a bumbling ignorant woman until you see her strength in supporting her husband in his moment of weakness and defeat. Theres more but all in the same vein of discovery of that which is at first hidden. ""The Dig"" connects past present and future one generation to those that came before and those that will come after. Truly a story for the ages.",10.0,2063

The characters are likeable the plot isnt exciting but if youre watching this movie its obvious youre not in it for excitement and fast-paced action! But then it crashes in slow motion. And of course in good old Hollywood fashion the token gay representation gets thrown in there. Why? My G*d is that going to happen with EVERY SINGLE MOVIE now? Its so painfully obvious and it absolutely destroys the flow of the movie. A side plot just to make room for political correctness. How utterly pathetic.

The Dig (the treasure the findings and what it all means to both present and future) exemplifies that plus other characters going through the similar worries either through health or by and large when theyre faced with an imminent threat of the war.

mzmck, The poignant haunting of death as the backdrop of our brief lives.,"Gary N. Kramer movie critic for Salon ezine wrote "" There is a nagging sense that the film should have played up the importance of the Sutton Hoo find more"" as he faults the movie for concentrating more on the characters than on the archaeology.I disagree with him as I watched this film with questions about life death how we live and the choices we make for whatever reasons at the time. As the archaeological find of the Anglo-Saxon burial ship proceeds we are confronted with the thought that this ancient ship was constructed then buried by real people. This plays out against the backdrop of England preparing for what we know will be a horrific war in which millions will be killed. Life in the midst of death death a presence in every life and yet we as a people live on. What will archaeologists of the future find of us?Ralph Fiennes conveys the the fully realized character of the proud stubborn excavator with profoundly effective subtle changes revealed by his eyes his pipe and his occasional hint of a smile. Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty the owner of mound being excavated is more of the cliched stalwart stiff upper-lip British lady; the well-written script heavily favors excavator Basil Brown.The director utilized a sure hand in the shaping of the film the cinematography was gorgeous and the only somewhat jarring note was the rather buffoonish behavior of the so-called professionals from time to time.",9.0,2083

Holt344," The Dig, a historical drama that should be on everyone's radar, a great and beautiful looking film",Dig reimagines the events of the 1939 excavation of Sutton Hoo. It stars Carey Mulligan as landowner Edith Pretty and Ralph Fiennes as the self-taught archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown both of them gave strong performances.The English countryside is its own character as the film wouldnt be as amazing if they wouldnt have shown off the gorgeous scenery. The cinematography is incredible its beautiful shot with natural lightning indoors and outdoors are stunning.The screenplay and overall writing is mostly good even great at times. But I felt the movie didnt need a romantic storyline that isnt historical accurate the big changes to Peggy Piggott is another thing I didnt really like as she is supposed to have been an experienced archaeologist and had studied archaeology for an example. The age difference for some of the actors is something I can look past except for Peggys husband which should be two years older.The musical score is simple but touching with its piano and other instruments Stefan Gregory created a phenomenal score thats so fitting to the film.Archeology is something I have always been interested in and seeing a film doing it in a realistic way was life. I knew nothing of the Sutton Hoo excavation before watching this film and after doing some research Im glad Netflix distributed it and gave Simon Stone the chance to direct it amazing direction and a great film.

rajesh-puvvada, A treasure,A ship had sailed a thousand nautical miles in sand and its still heading steady into the labyrinth of time and mind!!Time had buried the ship in Sand and yet it does not give up its worthiness!!You will have to dig for sure to unearth its magnificent appeal!!Set at the brink of the World War II a rich and dying women hires a self taught archeologist to unearth some mysterious land formations.A staggering find knocks many of the well taught archeologists down in to the mud!A strange bond develops between characters and the war dictates their destiny along with what they found.True credits appear late and so did the credit for Basil Brown. It took about 7 decades to get his name in the plaque at the British Museum.The tone of the film is mild and yet meandering!! The finesses of Ralph Finnes makes him adorable throughout. The ease in which he delivers complex parts of the character made me think loud!!At the moment many would ride the white tiger or follow the master without purpose. But _The dig_ is definetly a great find on Netflix.I am going with a 4.8 on 5. Please watch with a sense of curiosity because treasure is,9.0,2089
gettysburgrich, A Gem of a Film Unearthed in The Dig......Not to be missed,I feel so lucky to have found this beautiful slice of life film on Netflix. The true story from a book that will go on my list is touching and full of rich characters. These people are brought back to life by an astounding cast. These days where we are now accustomed to a series of episode to bring out the richness of the characters this small movie does it so well in just under two hours. It is a marvel not to be missed.,10.0,2090

john-83969, Excellent film,"The words ""based on a true story"" always puts me on alert. I know a film cannot be history and so characters and events always have to be simplified. In this case the story of Basil Brown is fundamentally true. Well done! The film is beautifully shot the atmosphere of pre-war Suffolk is captured in subtle muted colours and the local accent is accurately portrayed. Treat it as a film and you will love it. However if you look for the facts you will find many variances. In particular you will discover that Peggys liaison is fictional and the two actual photographers were omitted. The one startling omission for which the film loses a star is that the magnificent artefacts now in the British Museum are not shown just a few grubby bits of metal. It is beyond my belief that such a good director could miss this punch-line just before the credits.",9.0,2094

joesoundman, Like fine cognac,"Elegant and rich in its depth and restraint.Everything about it has an understated sureness of what is being presented. As ""Titanic"" used the oceanliner and its inevitable fate as the backdrop in a deeper story - albeit a fictional one so does this movie use its own backdrop as a fulcrum of sorts for several forays into the pathways of human experience.As always stories of humanity no matter how well the visuals are conceived and presented will fall flat and lifeless if the *characters* are not on a par with the screenplay and look. No worries: these main stars have never disappointed before and most certainly do not here! And the young actor somehow and unexpectedly - well hes about as good as it gets and his scenes with Fiennes are golden.Weve all seen movies that we users basically like a lot yet contradict the terrible scores from critics - ""Hillbilly Elegy "" anybody? - but when both user reviewers and critics are agreeing and are saying the same things its a pretty safe bet you will not be wasting your time. Imho it is especially true of this movie.",8.0,2096

writenamehere, Three films in one.,The Dig incorporates a true story with the themes in a novel and bits and pieces of present day industry trends. Mulligan and Fiennes in the lead roles bring their skill without reserve as do the remainder of the cast. Its worth watching for that. The parts that make it not very good is the over-attention to unrelated clichÃ© themes without any lead-in investigation or resolution; the historical goofs that really wouldnt have been that diffiult to correct; and the whole approach to how and when it was made. The most interesting theme related to the lead role was opened and closed within 30 seconds - very frustrating to watch rare opportunity so clumsily discarded.Overall its a reasonable TV movie that wont entirely make you want to smash your TV but itll leave you wishing that any of the three films it could have been actually existed.,6.0,2102

Recent reports appear to indicate that the characters bear little if any resemblance to the actual people involved.I cannot see anyone being interested in this as all we seem to see is rain and mud and a bit of treasure and even an inferred gay liaison.This is 2 hours of my life I cannot get back.,2.0,2114

Richard_Alex_Jenkins, Very relevant and rewarding,The world needs more subtlety like this.The story doesnt need to be groundbreaking riveting or shocking but can be about normal things that are expressed in a genuine way with top-notch acting across the board that helps The Dig tremendously.The thing that appealed to me the most were the sub plots of love endearment and commitment within the main plot of the film: the uncovering of some remarkable remains and treasures which hold the movie together and are the lynch pins but not the most important aspect of the story because its the underpinning relationships between lovers mothers sons and grandparents that bring The Dig full circle in an especially pleasing way.The movie isnt an epic one and there are very few triple-A scenes or effects that may have you drooling such as the incredible war scenes in Atonement but it does have enchantment in buckets and spades and hopefully like me youll be taken in and pacified by its extra slice of caring and love thats much needed in all of our lives whoever we may be.Watch it; its very very nice and the acting is an absolute delight.,8.0,2119
maccas-56367, The ultimate cup of tea film,"A beautiful film to watch and perhaps the ultimate ""cup of tea film"".Incredibly English. I really loved the relaxing meditative pace of it which reminded me of an old-school version of TV show Detectorists.Ralph Fiennes was loveable and effective in his transformation into Basil Brown. Carey Mulligan also delivered an effective yet understated performance in her roles as Edith. Lily James and Johnny Flynn added an extra layer to proceedings.The most impactful element here was that the film itself began to resemble ""a snapshot"" into the lives of others in a different time and place. The film itself felt like an archaeological dig into the past with little character studies here and there lives and loves just like the dig of the Anglo-Saxon treasure examined history.Recommend for those wanting a perfectly British movie to go with their cup of tea.",8.0,2120

georginacroft, Great film other than the historical inaccuracies - very sexist,I loved the film when I watched it - very well acted and interesting! Loved the way it was shot and the music. But I was so disappointed when I researched the real story afterwards and found out how the film had portrayed the women very inaccurately.It depicted the female archaeologist as inexperienced incompetent and to be honest dithering and pretended that she was only hired because she was lightweight and married to a male archaeologist. In fact she was an experienced and competent archaeologist in her own right. The male photographer was also a completely fictional character added as a love interest - because God forbid we could have a female character who doesnt have a romance! And the two women who really took the photographs were excluded. Very poor!,7.0,2122
classicsoncall," ""We're digging down to meet the dead.""",On the brink of Britains entry into World War II self trained archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) is sought out by land owner Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to excavate and investigate what look like ancient burial mounds on her property. Starting out as virtually a one man operation Browns early findings pique the interest of the local Ipswich Museum and eventually gains the attention of Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) of the British National Museum. Its not until the end of the picture that we learn the name of the Sixth Century Anglo-Saxon discovery which came to be known as the Sutton Hoo Treasure a burial ship with related antiquities dating back much further than originally expected. A number of human interest stories are inserted into the picture to humanize the participants as Ms. Pretty faces her own mortality with a debilitating illness while Mr. Brown takes a favorable liking to her young son an enthusiast of astronomy for which Brown is a willing mentor. As the film progresses the commoner Brown maintains a stoic resolve against the elitist pretensions of Charles Phillips and is favored by Ms. Pretty to receive the proper credit for his discovery. The film makers opt to sentimentalize the end of the picture with Britains entry into World War II as Ms. Pretty bequeaths the fantastic find as a gift to the British Museum where it would be seen by the most number of people. Held in safekeeping during the War in an underground location the Sutton Hoo was finally exhibited nine years after Edith Prettys death in 1942.,8.0,2123

Okonh0wp, A meditative slice of life film you're pleased to spend a couple hours in,"""The Dig"" might be seen by some as a boring period piece. Its true that it doesnt have much to say or move at much of a brisk pace.At the same time its a rare film that projects a warm comfort staying put. The relationships between the characters and the ephemeral tone makes this a nice place to spend two hours.Ralph Fienes plays an amateur archeologist constrained by the rigidity of British class (Ralph Fiennes): Hes the apotheosis of working class roots who has learned everything of the trade first-hand and is shut out of the mainstream archeological community.His counterpart Edith (Carey Mulligan) is a young widow of a higher class sitting in a wealthy manor that she would trade for company or a sense of having done something. She loves with a son a domestic staff she keeps at a distance and a quiet sense of regret over lives she could have lived including that of being an archeologist herself.The event that ties them together is the discovery of a Viking ship beneath her estate. The two form a beautiful platonic relationship (something cinema is severely lacking in) of admiration that bridges class in addition to the fact that one of the two got to fulfill their lives ambitions.As the dig gets bigger more characters are led into the story which includes a love triangle between Ediths cousin (Johnny Flynn) a junior archeologist from the museum (Ben Chaplin) and his wife (Lilly James) that serves as a reminder of what Ediths life might have been if she indulged in her desires.In the sense that many films might get you excited about a field of knowledge you didnt know much about like blackjack (21) brainwashing (Manchurian Candidate) or nuclear power (the China Syndrome) I left the film without much of a greater education on human archeology except for the most important part: The human stakes involved. Who gets credit for a discovery and can anyone truly deserve it for something someone else built? To what extent is the ability to gain knowledge driven by wealth and access to capital?This is what makes Dig worthwhile..",8.0,2125
fopfopfop, Decent film I didn't like the speculative affairs,I do short simple reviews. This film is about a real life dig that discovered a major treasure. It took place just before ww2 and dealt with that as well. However it fictionalized the story adding a homosexual relationship that never occurred in real life and an affair involving the wife of the closeted husband. I feel this was a tacked on ploy that was not true and was done because thats what Hollywood does. If it was real and Germaine to the real story I would have felt it relevant but the fact it was made up entirely is a disservice to the people that actually existed. Otherwise good acting directing competently made. Its not the best movie ever but intelligent and interesting enough to sacrifice 2 hours.,7.0,2126

Seamus06, Decent film the end left so many loose ends,The film was enjoyable. Good acting all around.My main gripe is with the end. They spent so much time on the relationship between the female excavator and the boys uncle and also the childs future when his mom passes away yet they arent even mentioned at the end. I assumed the child would end up with Basil Brown and his wife (no kids loving relationship with him) but not even a morsel of closure on that at the end. Maybe show the child walking off with them at least!,6.0,2132
heartspill, Don't expect bull whips and magic trinkets,It is quite amusing to read through negative comments of reviewers who obviously expected an action filled plot of the likes of Indiana Jones. But unlike Mr. Browns fictional contemporary the life of an archaeologist is a far cry from Hollywoods take on this humble profession. This film rather adequately depicts the reality of archaeology in the 1930s and 40s much of which still persists today. The shovel and mattock are more often the tools of choice than the trowel and brush. The tedious and often dull excavation work requires a strong social aspect and comradely on a site sees them through the often miserable work conditions with inadequate site facilities and unfavourable weather conditions that persist in this part of the world. It is thus no surprise that much of the movie shows these mundane but essential relationships the human aspect of being an archaeologist. It may come across as being dull but it is ample in accurately portraying archaeology.The arrogance of some formally trained archaeologists especially those of high reputation are legendary and the tension between the excavators and the scholars is portrayed rather well albeit with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humour. But there are also the difficult diplomatic endeavours to massage some egos and satisfy juxtaposed agendas by various parties involved just so that the excavation can continue. The excitement of finally revealing the secret of a site not always as sensational as Sutton Hoo - gold and other treasure are a rare occurrence indeed - make up for the all the hardships encountered.Archaeology during that time often lacked the scientific rigour of modern excavations and this movie adequately depicts this.The performances are convincing and do the true nature of the profession justice. The set of the excavation has been reconstructed with great care and the archaeology depicted true to the detail. All in all it is a slow but thoroughly enjoyable movie. If you loved Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider then this movie is probably not for you. If you love archaeology as much as I do then I would highly recommend it for you.,8.0,2133

ricovegas, Splendid character study,As usual the poor reviews were (it seems to me) written by those who really didnt understand the premise of this movie. Yes it is about finding artifacts in England at the beginning of WWII but in reality it is a character study about the folks whos lives were impacted by this marvelous discovery. With crisp writing and superb acting from all involved we are transplanted into the lives of ordinary people who stumbled into an extraordinary adventure. Some reviewers complained that too many extraneous characters were introduced at varying times but that (it appears) is how the actual events may have unfolded. And all of the characters are treated in a way that tries to explore their own demons and proclivities in a manner which never seems to wander into stereotypes. These were in fact average citizens and their lives deserved to be presented in an appropriate way. If you are looking for a documentary portrayal of this event then you may very well be disappointed. While the plot is admittedly quite thin everything else about this movie makes up for it.,9.0,2135

brucekuehn, Ralph Fiennes is quietly astonishing,"Acting for motion pictures is a strange occupation. A whole crew of people with their equipment is standing in front of a person pretending they are not there and trying to inhabit a character different than themselves. When all the work is finally done an audience watches and hopefully is transported away and into a story in an experience similar to a trance. In a really successful film there are many artists who are considered for the ""technical awards"" and The Dig is one of those but let me write about one actor.As an audience we know instantly when acting is done poorly but sometimes I fear we miss when it is performed so well that it is invisible. Ralph Fiennes (he is Welsh and everyone by now should know - pronounced like Rafe Fines) delivers a performance that is so complete that it is as close to perfection as anything Ive ever seen. There is not a millisecond where he is not this ""excavator"". He portrays a simple man who is very complex. He appears to be a common farmer who is really a self-taught intellectual. He is a humble man who knows his worth and wants to be remembered. Honest pride lies under a quiet nature. His job involves shoveling massive amounts of dirt while being directed by his acute scientific mind.All this is revealed by our actor. The body language the shuffling gate the stooped posture of a laborer but the quick eyes that show his knowledge. He also is a man of his time and not ours. There is something so authentic in the performance that it suggests time travel. He reminded me immediately of the old timers I knew as a boy who are now long dead. Men who never really got all the dirt out of the deep cracks in their hands.Ralph Fiennes never cries or shouts or has the long soliloquy but what a transformation! He simply becomes. That to me is what screen acting attempts but rarely achieves.",9.0,2140
deloudelouvain, Not bad in this genre.,The Dig isnt a movie I would normally go for as drama isnt the genre I enjoy the most but its also a biography what makes it interesting to watch. Its a story that is worth to be told that is easy and pleasant to follow. The cinematography is simple but effective nothing spectacular just flawless and professional. The acting from the whole cast is what makes this movie a good movie. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes were both very good in The Dig but so were the rest of the actors. Just dont expect a lot of action in this movie its a drama with an interesting biographical plot.,6.0,2141
daoldiges, Pleasant Dig,This should be viewed as 6.5/6+. The Dig looks great and has a wonderful pacing about it. The entire cast is all quite good in crafting uniquely distinct characters too. The story itself starts off well with an interesting dynamic developing between the two leads but about mid-way through it becomes less about them and the dig as a variety of additional characters and side stories appear. I think this weakens and dilutes the beginning storyline and energy but without really adding anything more or equally interesting. Still its a very pleasant film and worth checking out if your curious.,6.0,2142

noahtaylorvt, Bigger than just us,Established by early shots that somehow manage to capture a sky too big for any camera The Dig reminds viewers that life is more than the ground panning by our stumbling feet. Each and every camera shot is painstakingly placed matching up time of day to the emotions and nuance of the script. One can almost forgive some of the stilted and all too perfectly worded exchanges late in the film as inconsequential; weighted against the larger picture enveloping the viewer. Yet for every stumble in that script a verbal polished relic of adoration emerges to further bind image to sound.With the sheer volume and regularity of movies being released in the arms race of streaming services the script and story are often the lynch pin in weather or not a movie stands appart and yet the casting in The Dig almost asks us to forgo these thoughts and coalesce like water colors into a scene simply by the remarkable cast put together by Lucy Bevins. The directorial work Simone Stone cannot be understated here. His vision possibly shines the brightest in how understated yet convincing all of the actors take to their parts. Every actor on display sheds their persona and let the ensamble of characters story and music take the forefront.The score by Stefan Gregory fades and crescendos in harmony with the poetry on display continually throughout The Digs runtime. Comparisons with Jóhann Jóhannssons exceptional work in Arrival would probably be a solid association for moviegoers that enjoyed that sound scape. The interweaving violin and cello work had my breathe weaving in rhythm as the cinematography constantly impressed.If you are simply a fan of cinema The Dig will leave you feeling a sense of awe hope and comfort knowing that the form as art is alive and well.,8.0,2144
thekarmicnomad, What rainy Sunday afternoons were invented for,"On the outbreak of World War 2 the lady-of-the-house employs an excavator to dig up the Viking mounds in her garden.This is very slow and very gentle - there is zero action.Dont be fooled by the war setting or clips of spitfires - this is one of those exercise classes you can take sitting down whilst reading a book.It is also fantastic!The characters are amazing and the acting is superb.The story is very simple; but because you get to care for all the people involved it has real gravity to it.Issues of the age are there but portrayed in a subtle and meaningful way - a lot of modern movies treat the past in an overly theatrical way suggesting that anyone who strayed from the ""normal"" was instantly ruined or kicked to death in the street.The British stiff-upper-lip is handled amazingly here - the sacrifices people make to avoid ""causing a fuss"" are significant and heartfelt.It was nice to see people of the era portrayed as human beings doing what they thought was for the best (even if it wasnt) rather than just evil bullies.My parents are from that time and although not as dramatic for screen their mindset was not so simplistic or barbaric as some would like you to believe.I really liked the tone of this movie.I watched this with my girlfriend on a Sunday afternoon after a roast  tucked up on the sofa with snow falling outside.It was perfect!If you are after action or drama or twists or some powerful message then this is just not for you.Otherwise put the kettle on and enjoy.",9.0,2145

seandonmooy," Slow, real, excellent, human",A fantastic film. If youre a fan of 1930s literature youll enjoy this. Not a film about archeology but about archeologists - not a film about history but about our place in it.Ralph Fienns and Carey Mulligan perform excellently - and wonderful photography. A classic aching film that 2020 deserves.,9.0,2150

drgreenthumb1001, Potentially great historic film ruined by an agenda.,And that agenda is writing a script that follows the new rules of what the Academy will consider for their pointless award show which these days only crowns poor and corporate approved movies.This film moves along swimmingly until the Piggots arrive. Clearly all is not well it looks like we have a marriage of convenience if you get my drift. This subplot becomes as important and as relevant as the actual excavation as well as Ediths and Basil story .Even though right after the Piggots arrive most of the major treasures are found its not enough as the script eschews the interesting historical dig which the movie is SUPPOSED to be about for a romance subplot.I actually realized as I watched the final long scene play out that they had not even bothered to mention in the movie if a body had been found or if they had done any digging of the other mounds. You will find more of that information HERE on IMDB trivia page then in the movie.The movie ALREADY had characters you could care about in Edith Basil Robert and the fictional Rory character but to try and shoe-horn in the ole romance story on the eve of war trope all in order to be considered for the Oscars absolutely ruins the movie.This could have been a LOT better Ralph Fiennes is nearly wasted here as he become a secondary character once again AFTER the Piggots show up.This is NOT Oscar material but then again if you had told me 2 minutes after watching Parasite that it would later win best picture I wouldnt have believed you.,6.0,2152
alexandriaewhite, I had such high hopes.,As a current Masters student studying Medieval Art History I LOVE Sutton Hoo. Its one of my favorite archaeological digs and has some of my favorite art. I was so excited when I saw that this movie came out and was so ready to watch it. I could only make it halfway. It breaks my heart to say it.The way the movie starts feels like youve missed the first 15 minutes of the movie. The slow building of drama and plot was so slow that a movie made by tortoises would have been faster. It has a great cast and the camera work is amazing but I just couldnt get into the story. It was hard to even care about the characters. I grew up on British TV and films so I recognize that not all movies need to have Michael Bay explosions but this movie is so dry and dull. I will probably attempt to finish it (if only to see the recreated art work) at a later time when I have lower expectations.,5.0,2153

mlivziey, Best Netflix Movie to Date,I think I enjoyed this more than any previous Netflix original. It had great performances a little known story and was emotionally charged. It was slow at times but only because of the subject matter. Although this takes place during the year leading up to WWII it is certainly not a war film.Telling a true story without too many sensationalized bits is refreshing. I really enjoyed the movie and felt it didnt need any additional embellishments. Watch it for what it is and you will really enjoy it. I dont think it needed the added drama of the side-story relationships but I cant dock it much for the addition.Really well done film!,7.0,2158
bandini2," Quiet gentle story, for a change.","Without rehashing whats already been said a period piece set in the days immediately before the outbreak of WWII in which a group of ordinary people come together for an archeological dig but these characters themselves are set against the immense backdrop of the giant wheels of war beginning to slowly turn ahead of them and from behind eons of ancient history buried beneath them each one of those long dead souls having once experienced life as real as ours but now are dust beneath our feet. Then compared to the cosmos itself the entire earth is a speck of dust. Even so our lives are real and all we have so that Edith admonishes Peggy a young archeologist""Im sure your work is very sustaining but its not enough. Life is fleeting.

westerfieldreviews, The Unearthing of Fulfillment,"Simon Stone steers as the helmsman of this project to adapt for the screen a novel by the same name which is a proper slow burn of a movie only for those with the acquired taste. The Dig is a true adaptation of John Prestons 2007 novel also entitled The Dig which tells the real-life story of how the legendary Anglo-Saxon burial ship Sutton Hoo was discovered. Starring Ralph Fiennes Carey Mulligan and Lily James we follow all of their individual journeys as they work in tandem bringing to light this historical vessel with performances across the board that are nothing shy of wonderful. An overall strong screenplay by Moira Buffini shows the intricacies and complexities of the entire situation from nearly every angle that at times does lose its focus causing side stories to overshadow the main plot. The Dig will certainly not be a film for everyone as many may find the subject matter to be plain dull but it is without question a well-crafted film from opening to closing that will leave you satisfied.Set at the dawn of the Second World War in 1939 The Dig centers around Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) whose land she believes is ripe with treasure just waiting to be found. Given the position she finds herself in Pretty hires excavator Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) on a recommendation and he along with a few assistants from the estate work hand in hand to dig into the mounds of Prettys land to uncover what lies beneath. Following the discovery of a couple of iron rivets that once belonged to a sea vessel Brown informs Pretty and word of the finding slowly begins to trickle out. Once the news of the site goes public an excavation team formed by Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) comes forth and begins assisting on the project with hopes that Pretty will sell the ship to the British Museum for all to see. Along the way outside forces such as investors and buyers all do their best to persuade Prettys decision making as she suffers from a worsening medical condition which leads to personal strife Naturally their collective quest winds up revealing much about every single person who is present doing their part to unearth the Sutton Hoo leading to friction but ultimately understanding as everyone soon finds their personal peace.The highest mark that can be awarded to The Dig would come in the form of its characters and performances. Every individual character that is introduced throughout the film has a place in the narrative that allows no two characters to serve the same function or feel the same as the next. Although the focus of the film is on a small handful of characters everyone is given development into their stories which makes them far more believable while giving credence to their motivations from start to finish. All of the details feel purposeful and nothing appeared to be left on the table so for that I must give praise to Buffinis exceptional character writing. However characters and dialogue are only as good as the person bringing them to life. All of the main performers deliver good work that will keep you captivated as they navigate from scene to scene. Ralph Fiennes manages to do a lot with a little as his stoic assuredness bleeds through every word he speaks. Carey Mulligans tumultuous emotions ebb and flow as she battles with internal and external difficulties all while bringing a deep passion to the screen. Lily James personal conflict feels fully realized with every moment as she shines in a role that feels utterly soothing. And young star Archie Barnes delivers a moving performance that will have you experiencing every emotion as he steals nearly every scene he is in. All around The Dig is a triumph in character from both the written word to the dedicated performers not an ounce of talent feels wasted on either side of the camera.The major issues I detected while watching The Dig came in the form of its pacing and plot. The film has a fairly straight forward story that everyone can understand but it simply fails to make any of it interesting. Nearly every revelation presented within the film happens seemingly out of thin air with little to no build-up. A series of moments will transpire until something is revealed to the audience but it never feels earned because no gradual development is made thus making things feel meaningless when you should be feeling elated. On top of that there are at least two moments throughout the film where a character is turning their back and stepping away from it all but because a new incentive is placed forth they return to their duty. On its own this technique is fine but when done multiple times for the sake of adding extra scenes of dialogue it feels terribly pointless. However the biggest gripe I have with The Dig stems directly from its overall narrative. We are immediately introduced to a small handful of characters from its opening moments who all share a common goal. Then halfway through the film a bevy of new characters are introduced with their own stories that are so far removed from the main narrative leading to a shift in what we should and should not care about. When James character Peggy Piggott was injected into the script I was skeptical at first. However as her story unfolded I naturally grew to care for her struggle and subsequent growth more than I ever did with Pretty and Browns dig. Being far more interested in a romantic side story of a character and the backdrop of the war than the actual excavation is not a good sign. Unfortunately The Dig has all of the necessary components from dynamic characters to an interesting setting in England just before the birth of the Second World War but none of it can save the dreadfully dull plot.Simon Stones The Dig is a film that essentially suffers from a lack of genuine consistency. Buffinis expert screenplay brings Prestons original novel to life through great dialogue and even greater characters. Every performer gives it their all even if what is being presented is nothing all that engaging. Stones work behind the camera is fantastic with wide-reaching landscape shots that paint the beauty of the natural world to tracking shots that absorb you into its scenes effortlessly. Tragically the general story that is being told is one that fails to ""wow"" in any way and it also falls short of connecting the audience to its struggles leaving a significant taste of disappointment in ones mouth. Luckily the entire film does not drastically suffer because of the flat plot. Yet I must reiterate The Dig will not be a film that everyone will enjoy. From its slow pace to droning moments of silence it can at times have you checking your watch and looking elsewhere. In spite of that The Dig is a film worth watching full of riveting characters that carry it from start to finish in an excellent fashion.Final Verdict: C",6.0,2161

john-2023," Er...so, where's the treasure?",Just watched it on Netflix. Great watch despite the rather shocking lack of interest in the actual Sutton Hoo objects which are are barely shown. I was expecting a sort of montage of them over the end credits but no all we got was Ralph Fiennes reburying the ship as everyone prepped to hunker down and do their bit for WW2. Very strange omission especially for international audiences who must wonder at the end what all the fuss was about. Not enough to have a character yell that they proved Anglo Saxons werent cavemen. Likely revisions in the actual history particularly regarding ages of participants at the time (Carey Mulligan) sent us scurrying to Google to find out what was true and what was mayonnaise. A lot of mayonnaise! Especially regarding the romantic subplot but at least they avoided any Fiennes and Mulligan sexual tension despite the plot gasping for it as it were.,9.0,2166

kevin c, hidden treasure,Movie night with Iris.Period lace and tweeds but theres something a bit more deeper to this. The dig for treasure takes a bit of a back seat as its the looming WWII preoccuping people.

No Viking treasure will free these souls from the inevitability of war.The cast all capture that necessary sense of fragility as if they could all be snuffed out in an instant. Mulligans Pretty is a delicately handled performance as a woman processes grief and loneliness. Similarly Fiennes Brown is stubborn but a pained character.,7.0,2168

redban02," Good movie, beautifully shot; but may not be for everyone",The movie has a lot of strengths. Firstly the film is beautifully shot in a scenic location; and the score / music is superb. Secondly Ralph Fiennes gives a magnificent performance (Oscar-worthy). Thirdly the main plot is enough to hold your interest at least most of the time.The weaknesses of the film really depends on what youre looking for in a movie. The movie is not exactly casual watching. You have to really sit down and wait the movie closely. Some of the dialogue gets heavy and the little details require a lot of attention to catch. I also thought the subplot with the girl named Peggy (the girl with glasses) was dull or not as compelling as the main story involving Basil Brown.,8.0,2172
ron-newbold, Good but 5-10 minutes too long,Well worth making a film about the greatest archaeological find in Britain good performances but it would have benefitted from excising or reducing Peggy Lyons emotional issues with her husband. Its as if the makers thought an archaeologically centred film would be too dry without some kind of love interest. Instead more could have been made of what a narrow escape the Sutton Hoo find had. If it hadnt been found in summer 1939 that piece of land would have been used as a British Army tank training ground a few months later when war broke out. The ship would have been crushed and most or all of the treasure lost forever.,7.0,2173
AJ_McAninch, A Lovely Film About Connections and Passages,"""The Dig"" is a slow-paced lyrical story about one of the most famous and amazing architectural discoveries in history. But it is more which is why there are some spaces and compressions in the excavation timeline.

But it got worse than the stolen titles of the classic LucasArts Game ""The Dig"" (which actually is about a dig site in space) or the hat of Ralph Fiennes reminiscent of someone called Indiana Jones. I thought the drama follows only Ms Pretty but then it turns out that every woman is depressed the guys are mainly delusional and the different story branches are going nowhere.We have an amateur dig man Mr Brown who makes every mistake in the beginning that you can ""achieve"" at a dig site. Then we have the fat museum guy who is incapable of leading a team nor collect the discovered items. And after the first half of the movie relationships go south so everybody is whining in self pity. And why the fuzz about some sand dunes that used to be wood of a ship? The music is accordingly depressing and monotonous. The films running time is around two hours and the director had all the time to tell a good story. But he missed the chance to deliver an admirable film. Instead I was left with a yawning face. Good night.",1.0,2182
sspina, Well done but unnecessary,This is the type and style of film that I normally love but this one just didnt connect with me.To start with the positive the casting was great Carey Mulligan is fantastic as always. The cinematography was beautiful the dialogue was well written and felt really believable.Now to my issues with the film:To start with a lot of my criticisms are just things that irritate me personally in films and theyre to do with editing. The main ones being:a) when the music is more dramatic than the scene warrants. The score for this was nice but just like these big dramatic orchestral pieces for like most of the film when there was not all that much happening.B) the overuse of the thing where theres dialogue playing over a different scene. This works when the scene happening is relevant to the dialogue or if theres a clear connection or dramatic irony at play or if its used for like a few seconds as a scene changeover. But this was like long bits of conversation playing over like a bit of a scene that was completely unimportant. Like were hearing a conversation but seeing the characters walking to the place where theyre having that conversation for a really long time for no reason... that just bothers me when its used frequently in a film Id much rather see the conversation thats actually happeningBut my actual main criticism of this film was that I just didnt feel like there was enough story to fill a film. The story and the characters just werent particularly interesting for me. I dont really feel like I learned anything or took anything away really. I didnt connect emotionally with any of it really and there wasnt really the highs and lows of tension that you expect from a film.And dont get me wrong I usually love a slow film when its well done but this just felt like a bit of a waste of time to me so I was disappointed I was so sure I was going to love this film but...never mind!,5.0,2183
steffern, Utterly dull,I was expecting an easygoing movie with an optimistic and maybe adventurous outlook perhaps containing a few interesting facts or insights.

I cant believe I watched it till the end.,2.0,2184
peferguson, One Of The Best of The Year,"""The Dig"" 2021A made for Netflix period piece The Dig recalls those dark days as Great Britain prepares to go to war with Hitlers military machine. An amateur yet skilled archaeologist Basil Brown is retained by the wealthy owner of the Sutton Hoo estate to allow him to search for ancient artifacts on her sprawling farm. Mrs. Edith Pretty rankles The British Museums curator by selecting Mr. Brown university over degreed archeologists supported by him.Basil enlists the estates farm staff and the young son of Mrs. Pretty Robert to begin searching for the treasure trove. Her handsome brother Rory (Johnny Flynn) joins the dig and falls in love with Mrs. Prettys assistant the lovely (and very married) Peggy Piggott (Lily James). A substantial sub-plot is developed by this entanglement.Mr. Browns surprising father-like mentoring of Robert is a wonderful second sub-plot that adds an endearing twist to the story.Clearly one of the best films of the year Aussie Simon Stone directs a beautifully flowing tribute to Brown. Stone is best known as an actor but received praise for 2015s The Daughter his first directorial outing which he also wrote.The Dig is a huge cinematic success; Mike Eleys eye for the simplicity of the land and delicacy of the English countryside is praise-worthy. Stone and Eley both have earned Oscar considerations.Clearly this is Ralph Fiennes tour-de-force. He makes one genuinely care for his Basil Brown. Fiennes portrayal of Browns steadfast allegiance to Mrs. Pretty and her son really adds to the re-telling of this true story. Cary Mulligan as Edith Pretty is wonderful as always playing a character who was fifteen years older than herself.In this time of the pandemic The Dig made yet another night stuck at home enjoyable and more interesting. Do yourself a favor and seek out this cinematic joy.",9.0,2185

It is a great pity then that this movie is just dull. It shouldnt be. This movie tells the story of arguably the greatest archaelogical find in 20th century Europe. It is a story that is just made for excitement and suspense and triumph. The movie has none of these qualities. It is all told very matter-of-factly. There are a couple of attempts to inject some human interest into the proceedings with a subplot dealing with the health of one character and a perfunctory and unnecessary romance between two others but sadly it is all just rather dull.I really wanted to like this movie and the best I can say is that I didnt hate it.

Kubrickfan15, Anthony Hopkins best performance since Silence of the Lambs,My grandfather struggled with dementia for the last few years of his life and this movie helps me understand his experience and struggles so much better. I am blown away with how moving and incredible this movie was. This is a film everybody should watch. Motion Pictures like this are the reason I love film.Edit: I just saw the news tonight about Anthony Hopkins getting his second Oscar. I think this is one of the most well deserved Oscar wins I have seen. Although he will probably never see this I would like to thank Anthony for providing his incredible acting. It was one of the most heart wrenching things I have watched and it means so much to me. The Oscar is definitely an incredible accolade for Anthony but most importantly this is a performance that I know will touch the hearts of many as it did mine.,10.0,2211
alexpn66, So good I never want to watch it again,The Father might be the saddest film Ive ever seen. With a heartbreaking powerhouse of a performance Anthony Hopkins is at his absolute best. This puts you in the shoes of a man whose mind is deteriorating. I fully recommend that everyone see this movie. As great as it is it is not one I want to rewatch anytime soon.,10.0,2212
joshuaporteous, How does one respond when they cannot know reality?,"How does one respond when they cannot know reality? This is the main question of the Father.The Father is adapted from director Florian Zellers stage play by the same name. The story centers on Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) an aging man who slowly loses his grip on reality due to dementia. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) does her best to care for him but she too has a life she wants to live-her boyfriend Paul (Rufus Sewell) has asked her to move to Paris with him. Anne struggles to find an aid who can handle her father so that she can get on with her life. Zeller shared that his inspiration for the film was watching his grandmother who raised him pass away from dementia. You can feel the emotion coming through every part of the film.The movie starts with Anne confronting Anthony for chasing off the last assistant. Anthony claims he did it because she stole his watch. Anne patiently reminds him that he put it in his hiding place. She goes and finds the watch in his ""secret"" hiding place. At first we are able to chuckle about the situation but we soon become just as confused as Anthony. The tone of the movie shifts when Anthony stumbles upon a man in his flat who claims to be married to his daughter. He waits for Anne to return from the store to sort things out but when she arrives she is a different woman entirely.The rest of film has confusing moments like this. Once you think you have sorted things out they are flipped again. I watched this at the premier at Sundance and during the Q & A after the film a woman asked if Anne went to Paris with Paul or not. Zeller responded that we dont know that answer the answer is not what is important. Zeller stated that he wanted us to be as confused as Anthony and give up on trying to sort things out and just feel. And feel we do.Anthony Hopkins performance drove the emotion. His masterful control of minor expressions and vocal nuance intensified the whole film. I would not be surprised if he wins best actor next year. Zeller admitted that he named the character ""Anthony"" because he wanted Anthony Hopkins to play the part. (The part was literally written for him.) Anthonys emotions swing in the film driven by his loss of memory and disorientation to events. Everyone seems to be on edge not knowing how Anthony will respond. One moment he is happy the next he is distressed. This comes out strongly when Anthony meets Laura (Imogen Poots) for the first time. Laura is a young woman who Anne has set up as Anthonys new caregiver. Anthony begins telling Laura how he used to be a tap-dancer. The scene is funny and Laura laughs throughout. Suddenly Anthony remarks that Laura reminds him of his other daughter because of her inane laughter-and the mood has swung.The key question in the audiences mind is ""What is reality?"" Zeller disorients Anthony and the audience by having different actors play the same characters then switching back. Zeller rearranges the same apartment so we are unsure where we are-Anthonys apartment or Annes. Anthony tells different versions of his career and we even seem to experience events out of order. The only thing we are certain of is that they dont even speak English in Paris!This is not to say that there are multiple realities but that Anthony cannot access what the true reality is. As the audience we become like Anthony-confused. We do not know what his daughter looks like or if she is married. If she is which man is her husband? However this confusion over reality is meant to push us beyond discovering the truth and just feeling the helplessness of someone suffering from dementia. And to this point it works.But it takes us beyond this. By the end of the film we are all confused. We cannot access what reality is and now it is time for us to ask ""How do we respond?"" The film has its answer but Ill leave it up to you to feel if you agree. This is one film that has to be watched to appreciate because it focuses on the feeling of the experience and not the truth of the experience.A couple extra notes:First Zeller shared that the classical music that Anthony listens to throughout the film is Hopkinss favorite music. Hopkins always wanted to be in a movie that used this music and now he got the chance.Second often movies adapted from stage plays can feel very confined and unnatural to the screen. Events that would naturally lead a character elsewhere seems to falsely confine them to that space since the play needs to keep them there. However Zeller does a nice job at expanding the world and making the small space feel new. Most of the film takes place in the apartment but because of the rearrangement and use of different rooms in the apartment it feels larger and natural.",9.0,2213

While other films have taken on old age and dementia those films took on coping with a significant others condition. The difference here is that the film is from the sufferers perspective. You therefore see these events as if you yourself have dementia. And its stunning how when you walk away you know you can.,9.0,2215

Beach412-1," Another Oscar winning performance by one of the greatest actors of our time, Anthony Hopkins",Anthony Hopkins easily the greatest actor of our times in his gut wrenching portrayal of a man suffering from Alzheimers. Seamlessly expressing ranges of humanity from Hannibal the monster in The Silence of the Lambs to his latest nominated role in The Father as he slowly slides into the horror of this father as he loses his mind witnessed primarily through his caregiving daughter portrayed by the brilliant Olivia Colman. The sliding in and out of his past and present flows beautifully through the steady direction of writer/director Florian Zeller an acclaimed playwrite from France breaks your heart terrorizes you as you travel through his lifes trauma giving way to his rage as it seethes through every expression from a long life survived as hes losing his grip on reality.

sinefilcinephile, Brilliant...,Give Anthony Hopkins the Oscar on April 26. He gives you the best performance of the decade. An old man with dementia loses his ties to reality. His mind deteriorates and reality stops making any sense. This movie will haunt you especially if you have a relative with dementia. Such a heartbreaking movie. ABSOLUTELY the best movie of the year and the best performance of the year by Hopkins.,10.0,2219
historiafilms, Sometimes You Forget How Great an Actor Is ...,And then you get Anthony Hopkins in THE FATHER. This is a devastatingly heartbreakingly-brilliant performance and a great film. Hopkins range is incredible. He goes from charming and funny to menacing to wholly lost in seconds. From man to child on a dime. Its a powerful rumination on a terrifying disease bolstered by Sir Tony at his finest a strong supporting turn from Olivia Colman and an excellent script by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (based on Zellers play). Its a daring move to tell the story from the perspective of Hopkins character as his mind increasingly deteriorates. A savvy one too as the audience is forced to engage to truly understand what is real who is who and where precisely we are in our protagonists gut-wrenching journey. This may be Hopkins best work a late-career revelation that once again reminds us why hes one of our finest cinematic performers. Be warned. If youve ever been touched by the tragedy of dementia this film could wreck you.,9.0,2220

pedroborges-90881, The Father Review,Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance one of the best in his career is hard to decide who deserve more the best actor between him and Chadwick Boseman i know is controversial but i would vote for Hopkins.Olivia Colman also gives a great performance showing all the sadness a person would feel in this situation but Hopkins is the one who elevated the whole material.The ending scene is very emotional and sad showing once again how amazing is Hopkins performance when he cries asking for his mother who is obviously dead a long time ago this just shows even deeper how much hes lost in the time of his own life the scene also make us see that a person in his condition can feel like a helpless kid who lived a entire life and now is completely lost and confused sometimes not even capable to remember who he actually is.,9.0,2222

petarbrankovan, I never thought that sir Antony will have scarier part then one he had in The Silence of the Lambs,"This is the film that hooks you and dont let go until the final shot. Sir Tony is just incredible in this one. His character is loveable relatable and has that charm that in spite of dementia still shines through him. As the title says he plays the father of adorable and caring Olivia Coldman which is in mine book after seeing her astonishing performance one of the best actresses in the world of cinema right now. She is soo good in emitting emotions to the screen that she could do that with her mimicking alone no words needed. Seeing sorrow in her eyes while looking after the man who raised her is just hard to watch. But the preformanse at the end of the film given by the veteran of cinema sir Antony Hopkins is just OUT OF THIS WORLD. I never felt that way while watching a movie. It was like a giant stone was pressed on my chest and i started sobbing like a child first time after untimely death of my father 10 years ago. Thanks God I watched the movie alone. Anyway cinematography and direction are great also the script lighting and music. And no matter witch ""political correct"" movie get Oscar this year for me will always be this one..",10.0,2224
Rytl, Best film of 2020/21?,I hope Zeller moves from the theatre to film full time because this thing is sublime. Dementia (Alzheimers disease) runs through both sides of the family Ive seen the disease full throttle. It is nasty and heart-breaking; it destroys everyone around the person suffering.Ive a big soft spot for almighty performances. I get a buzz off seeing an actor harness everything in their being to master the craft (DDL in There Will Be Blood; PSH in Capote The Master). Hopkins is 83; he delivers an absolutely abnormally outrageous performance. One in which if youre watching it right will linger long after. Its mesmerising.But to oversell on the acting alone is to do Zeller a disservice. Coleman is also great. The film and its script (adapted from the stage) is just beautiful. It sucks you in allowing you to fully realise the disease in all its terrible and dare I say it funny contradictions. I wouldnt want to spoil this for anyone. I reckon you should go for it; the worst that can happen is you turn it off after 20 minutes when you realise its not for you. It was for me. Utterly brilliant.,10.0,2225
TrueWouve, And the Oscar goes to...,"I had the wonderful opportunity to see The Father at CIFF this year. I went in excited to see what Sir Anthony Hopkins would do with a study on dementia. As I consider Sir Anthony as arguable the best actor in film these days I had pretty high expectations. And I was not at all let down. When his character also named Anthony become confused or curmudgeonly you recognize some of his other great performances. But in fact I was most impressed at how warm and charming of a character Sir Anthony could also play. He was just simply spell binding when his character was his ""old self"". With all this being said perhaps the most remarkable performance of the film comes from Olivia Colman who plays Anthonys daughter Anne. The patience frustration hurt and unwavering love depicted while Anne tries to find the best way to care for her father is truly remarkable. Im sure there will be Oscar buzz for both of these performances and for the adapted screen play of Director Florian Zeller.Now a little SPOILER to help people better enjoy this film. The Father in a way is shot like a mystery. Time lines are repeated  characters change in the story all while the audience sits confused. You do by the end understand that this is done to represent the progression of Anthonys disease. And you as an audience get to experience the strangeness of a mind that is being let down by itself. This is presented as a kind of plot twist. But I think the film will be more enjoyable for most if you understand in advance what is going on.",9.0,2226

csigrissom-57506, Lost In Your Own Mind,This film should be watched as a lesson/warning to help understand the curse of Alzheimers/Senility.My dad developed Alzheimers and over the years became a different man to the one I knew. It started with little things. Hed lose his wallet. A couple of times hed take the cash from Mas purse and lose it. He had worked as a plumber. One day I went to visit him. As I opened the front door I smelt gas. There was dadin the front room with a stripped out gas fireabout to use a blow torch. That was the day Ma told me she couldnt cope and so I moved back home to help look after him. Slowly he got worse. Hed go out early in the morning for walks. Sometimes in just his underwear. Once he managed to leave the house and we ended up having to call the Police. They found him. I started staying awake most nights to watch him. I was already an insomniac. Watching him change from my dad into someone who didnt know me was difficult. The Drs told Ma that dad needed to go into a care home. We had to have him committed. I have always regretted that. He was visited everyday whilst in the care home. When he was living at home I had given up my job to care for dad and so I could spend several hours with him daily. Wed go for walks. Have a fish & chips lunch. By this time I was almost a stranger to him. Occasionally hed think I was his brother. Though he always spoke of the sons who never bothered to visit him. Ma would quite often have to buy dad a new watch as hed lose them. The hardest part of this cruel disease for us was that dadlike the man in this filmhad forgotten that his daughter had been killed in a traffic accident 20 years before. Hed often ask where she was. We never told him the truth. There were times when he became violent(something the illness seemed to bring out in him). Sometimes dad would have a lucid moment. It always surprised me when he called me by my name. Those were the times that became really special to me. Id ask him questions about his life. Those moments only lasted a few mins. I used to wonder what dad would say ifduring a lucid momentI had shown him a video of the man he had become. Im fairly certain hed have asked me to put him out of his misery. He was always a very proud man.,10.0,2229
isaacsundaralingam, Probably the only movie I've seen that discusses aging and dementia in any meaningful capacity,"One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufmans Synecdoche New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zellers The Father is the closest Ive seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.The movie was unsettling from start to finish... in the best way possible. Its one that shows the unstable world around the aging Anthony but with the underlying vigilance that whats ""wrong"" is not necessarily the world around him. And the horror of ones rationality clinging on to his very last bit of sanity is shown in the most surprisingly human way possible and its what makes The Father one of the finest movies of the year.Special credits to stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman who undoubtedly make the movie as every bit emotional and human. And Hopkins performance in this movie is by far my favorite of the year. Overall a very intense yet rewarding viewing experience that no one should miss out on. Do yourselves a favor and check it out!!!",10.0,2230

mbrcf, A magnificent work,TIFF 2020 12The FatherBase on the stage play by the same name director Florian Zeller adapts his own play to the big screen telling the story of Anthony (Sir Anthony Hopkins) an elderly man dealing with severe case of Alzheimer disease with some stages of dementia and his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) who tries her best to take care of her father.With the help of an unconventional script and some illusion-inducing cinematic techniques we are seeing the most parts of the film from Anthonys viewpoint. Some scenes repeats themselves with completely another character replaced some elements form the set are altered or entirely disappeared even the house Anthony is living in may change completely and through these modifications we get to experience the dementia that is affecting Anthony (or many real life people for that matter) and his sense of perception.This film makes brilliant use of every part and aspect to tell its story in the most compelling and intriguing way possible. Both performances by Hopkins and Colman are phenomenal and writer/director Zeller knows exactly what he wants to do and does it with eagerness and care. It is not certainly enjoyable per se but it is surely thought-provoking and memorable.,8.0,2241

My grandfather had dementia and seeing this film brought back the memories so vividly that it almost made me want to stop watching.

jamesjustice-92, Where is my mind?,Now this is what I would call the Best Picture of 2020 and Anthony Hopkins surely deserved his Oscar for such a complex character he portrayed.As I was watching the movie it was as if I was in Anthonys head trying to figure out heads and tails of everything that was going on: who am I where am I whats my story who are the people around me is it my apartment what happened ten minutes ago and finally is it real at all? The cinematography is fantastic how the transitions are made up into one big loop of events that round up to make sense but in the end nothing really makes sense when youre losing your memory to a weary old mind.I guess it will take multiple watches for me to look out for all of the details I missed to make a picture to at least seem whole but as of now The Father is a perfect representation of whats really happening inside the head of an old sick man and Sir Anthony played his part gracefully and was very touching. So did Olivia Colman and all the rest of the cast.Overall I feel like theres so much left for me to discover in this movie and this is literally the best thing about the art of cinema: that it puts a seed of wisdom or a thought into your brain and let it blossom naturally and when the movie is as great as this one is with every new rewatch it will give your tree of thoughts more and more branches colors and beauty.,10.0,2248

alexandraza, A FATHER HARD TO FORGET,"When I started watching an Oscar movie with the incomparable Sir Anthony Hopkins I didnt know what ""Im getting into""!The Father -2020 is a film that does not make you feel good but makes you deeply sad it makes you go through all the possible states and even makes you think that ... you never know what fate is preparing for you!Quite static (taking place in 3-4 rooms and a long hallway) the film becomes dynamic due to the fact that the action takes place in fact in the ravaged mind of a father with Alzheimers.Incredible and terrifying is the illustration in images of the darkness in the mind of a confused man: the plans overlap the rooms change the characters are or are not what they seem ... everything is unclear ... and in the center of all is always him the old man with a confused and confusing smile on his lips.I dont think he would have been another better actor for this role. Even the writer / director Florian Zeller didnt think otherwise offering the script since 2017 to the great actor and refusing to make the film without him (the characters name is Athony because it can only be his) Ffff inspired choice because Hopkins is masterful! Merit that was recognized this year with an Oscar (the actor has another for Silence of the Lambs - 1991) being the oldest actor who received this distinction at 84 dethroning him (if you can say that even though everyone has well-established place in the panoply of great actors as well as in our hearts) Christopher Plummer who was awarded at the age of 82.Olivia Colman (as Annes daughter) is slightly overshadowed by Hopkins overwhelming personality (who wouldnt she be ?!) yet she plays a wonderful role.The film also has parts in which music plays an important role Hopkins being a great lover of classical music and even singing the piano. The area from Bizets ""Pearl Fishermen"" was chosen for the film at his suggestion being one of his favorites.I dont think there is much more to say about this film (it ""took my maul"" anyway as they say) and I dont even know if it would be good to recommend it to people who have old or sick parents or to young people who dont he would (still) understand its depth.""The Father"" is such a realistic movie that its good to put on a list and watch only when you have the necessary mood but ... by no means ignored!",9.0,2262

TruthTeller98765," The Best Movie of 2021 (I watch a lot of movies, FWIW)","The Father is a difficult film to review. It is not an easy film to watch but it is not an exploitative trauma film like so many other movies and shows out there right now. In some ways The Father is the scariest horror film that I have ever seen. You need to be emotionally prepared to watch this film and the Alzheimers disease reality that it presents. This is not a ""date night"" movie. Schindlers List has more lighthearted moments in it than The Father.Do not let these comments discourage you from watching The Father though. If you are a fan of cinema and the wide breadth of emotions that it can elicit The Father is simply a jaw-dropping exposition into the very raw emotions that this disease can and has inflicted on countless generations of families including my own. You will probably not want to re-watch The Father as soon as it is finished and that is okay. It reminds me of Requiem for a Dream (2000) in that both films are very emotionally powerful but I was not dying to see either of them again right after I saw them the first time. Some films are better left to marinate on our consciousness and The Father is certainly one of those.",10.0,2264

FilmChamp20, Watch before you read my review,I understand the frustration of the ending. I was going to write off this movie as bad. Then I thought for a little bit.Heres my theory:I believe Albert wasnt the killer. I know thats a common consensus. I dont think Deke or Jimmy was either. However the confusion and frustration of not getting an answer from the film is actually the result expected. We as an audience are to feel just as lost and frustrated with the unknown and unresolved as Deke and Jimmy do. To feel just like how it is to be a obsessive Detective to the point where your perception has become so skewed from obsession youre desperate for an answer. To the point where you break and it has consequences. Perhaps to show us how being a dedicated detective has its weight that finally breaks them down. Deke knows this finally as Jimmys situation wakes him up however he doesnt want Jimmy to become him. Thus buying the red clip to assure Jimmy that Albert was actually the killer thus making him feel justified in killing him. While in reality it wasnt Albert and its another burden that Deke has to carry on with within his conscious.All in all I believe the movie is to show the best of the best get a breaking point at some point not wanting to admit defeat or that they just arent as good as they used to be. Because all the sacrifices they give to dedicate their time into finding the killer or victims they want it to be time that was well spent instead of time wasted making their life miserable.,7.0,2270
darkreignn," Great cast and premise, brought down by bad editing","""Its the little things that get you caught"" Deke played by Denzel Washington tells Rami Maleks character Jimmy. ""Its the little things that rip you apart."" Unfortunately I found that second sentiment particularly resonant as I watched ""The Little Things.""""The Little Things"" had a phenomenal trailer very nuanced well lit choreographed acted and most importantly well edited. Of course the trailer was only two minutes long. How does the actual film which is over two hours long compare? Surely any movie that expands on the technical prowess and acting chops that the trailer set up will be fantastic! The movie does expand on all of the pieces the trailer introduced - in doing so ""The Little Things"" takes one step forward and two steps back. Admittedly the movie looks good visually; the cinematography is appropriately moody with dim lighting for the majority of the running time that casts an ominous shadow over its characters.The acting too is incredible. Ive seen mixed reviews on Rami Maleks acting in this movie but I thought he was great if a little mumbly which did make it hard to understand him (thank you subtitles). Denzel Washington is as always great. He puts on a quiet performance here that takes its time with viewers - you can tell theres something below this character thats waiting to bubble up. Denzel is a professional and he acts like one; every word out of his mouth feels believable every action he takes feels realistic for his character. Watching him and Malik collaborate to catch a killer is truly entertaining - Deke sucks Jimmy into his obsessive mindset and its interesting watching both of them fall deeper into the rabbit hole theyve dug for themselves.Jared Leto as the might be might not be killer is fascinating. Now granted I may be biased because I like Jared Leto but I thought he was pretty good in the role. His character was perfectly bizarre always keeping Deke and Jimmy on their toes. Sure Jareds character may act like a complete weirdo but is he a killer? The movie keeps you and its characters guessing which I appreciated. The story which obviously focuses on these three characters is elevated by the amazing performances. In a better film I could see some serious Oscar contenders.Yes I did say ""in a better film"" because ""The Little Things"" does start to fall flat. Lets talk about the editing - did Olivier Megaton secretly direct this? Who decided on the editing style of this movie? There were a distracting amount of cuts in practically every single scene - for example a scene where Denzel says goodbye to his dog before getting in his car has probably upwards of ten cuts. Similarly a scene where Deke and Jimmy are eating breakfast has probably 20 cuts. There is rapid fire editing at play here and Im not sure the reason why. The film wouldve greatly benefited from a slow and steady editing style that allowed the camera to linger on its scenes and characters; instead we get something akin to Paul Greengrass which definitely doesnt fit the tone of the movie.Because of that tonally the movie is inconsistent. The pace feels all over the place with the film only picking up when Jared Letos character comes in the picture. Unfortunately he starts to play a major role about an hour or more into the movie which means you spend a majority of this films length focusing on nothing really memorable. Additionally the movie felt too short even though it was over two hours long. There had to be scenes cut out of here perhaps even scenes that further expanded as to why Deke and Jimmy were so obsessed over Jared Letos character. It seems like they pick him as a suspect out of thin air; as you hear in the trailer they find him suspicious because his car has high mileage. Thats it? After Deke discovers this they seem laser focused on nailing Letos character and I was wondering if I somehow missed another clue or piece of evidence that made Deke and Jimmy get so fixated.I did really enjoy the ending and overall message of the movie - this is definitely not a crowd-pleaser and I commend the so different approach that the movie took. However I really cant excuse the awful editing and the stagnant pace. In a better movie the first hour wouldve been the first 30 minutes with Letos character being introduced early to build the tension and obsession of Jimmy and Deke. However because ""The Little Things"" spends its first hour on nothing too significant by the time Jareds character is finally introduced youll wonder what the movie can possibly pull out of its hat to keep you interested now that its almost over. ""The Little Things"" is a film with great performances and a really interesting premise that is brought way down by its editing pacing and tonal inconsistency. Its a perfectly watchable film but with this cast it shouldve been much better than it ends up being.",7.0,2271
shorn-40895, Satisfaction Is Not A LIttle Thing,"A movie can leave feeling any number of ways-happy sad amazed provoked whatever-but the common denominator of good ones is that when the lights go up you feel satisfied; it was worth the trip. I didnt fee that way when this one ended. Yes it made its point: a detective working a murder case can become obsessed; its the burden of responsibility seeking justice retribution vengeance-choose your word-for the victim. And the point of the story is the old proverb: ""Before you set out on a journey of revenge dig two graves"" (or something like that). Thats all well and good but IMO this story melted away in the last 30 minutes. With some hard work on the script and more inventiveness it could have been so much more.",7.0,2272
MagooWho," Wanted To Like It More, But Enjoyed It Anyway!","SPOILERS AHEAD!!Like many others I expected more from this movie considering the fabulous cast and the well-constructed trailer. This is one of those films that I truly wanted to LOVE.Ill list my PROS & CONS to include the positives and negatives that I may have overlooked in a more general review.CONS:Not very original storyline too much copied from David Finchers ""Sev7en"" or Denzels ""Training Day"" (both of which included the ""retiring-cop-teaching-new-rookie-the-ropes"" theme). It was a challenge to convert my mindset to the PRE-smart phone technology of the early 90s which made the instant communication factor non-existent. Of course that is no ones fault just frustrating lol. I guess if the story took place currently it would have been a completely different plot.Too much jumpy editing from scene to scene.Too much focus on Sparma being the sole killer not including any other tentative perps.Flashback overkill to inform the viewer how deeply Denzels unsolved murders were haunting him. It seems they disrupted most scenes where he was alone. We get it we get it hes traumatized by his past of unsolved murders and his accidental killing of the female victim.Big plot hole with Jimmy trusting Sparma by turning his back on him while digging the holes. Actually trusting Sparma enough to get into his car in the first place is not believable especially with Jimmy believing Sparma was the killer. It was out of his character to make himself that vulnerable.On a technical note I could not hear some of the dialogue no matter how high I added volume...like the characters were mumbling or speaking too fast. It must be a technical issue that was not intentional.Could have been 30 mins. shorter to tell the exact same story.PROSStory was interesting enough to keep me guessing about Sparmas involvement in the murders.Denzel buying the red barrette for Jimmy (sneakily) to help him with closure and maybe lessen Jimmys guilt. That was a clever and unique plot device imho.Unlike other viewers I dont feel that Jared Leto was overacting. His creepy character was convincing to me.Ill add more points to my review later if I think of any.",7.0,2273

ddamo-13945, Great way to spend a pandemic Friday evening.,I love Denzel Washingtons movies. He is a great actor- a little one Dimensional but man he is so believable. He is great at his craft.This movie made me sit up snd take notice. I am a retired police officer and have worked my share of cases. (Not homicide) I recognized the great research of police procedures snd the technical application of them. All cops who see this movie will appreciate the attempt to remain authentic to law enforcement.The story line was great with a wonderful who-done-it feel. Great dialogue and very well written. The element of being unforgivably connected to a murder that is from the past that is connected to the future that is connected to the past is as profound as it is plausible. Great work.Dekes hopes of salvation in this life and the next are tied to a young and cocky detective partner that comes to realize forgiveness can be hauntingly elusive.Watch this movie-it is as about as close as youre going to get to the frustrations and limitations of real police work.,8.0,2282
Mikee_Maher, A man confronts his past!,Dont get confused here this films tells the story of a man (Joe Deacon) who has a history in Los Angeles and after a couple of years he gets to confront his past! This film is very misleading cause at a point you feel like it lost its storyline. It is a slow film with a lot of questions some answers you get very late and some you dont. Performances are great from everyone Jared Rami and Denzel. I think what the film tries to tell us is that the little things we do have a big impact on what we feel and what we could become. And also the past is the future and the future is the past. Not a perfect film but not that bad either.,7.0,2283

There was nothing to make me care about any of these characters which is a shame because the opening scene is good. You can just shut the movie off after that cause theres no point. The movie is an hour too long. My husband fell asleep and managed to wake back up before anything ever actually happens - an hour in.

DelaRed, if Denzel wasn't the lead . it would go straight to cable Tv-movie .,Yeah on paper the movie looks good .3 oscar winning actors and a good director but the translation to the screen its just plain awful .The acting was below the standard of these actors . The only standout among the 3was Denzel who gave a good performance but nothing special or challenging about his character which we have seen in dozen movies before . while the supporting cast were absolutely dreadful .Jared who played the weird and creepy repairman tried his best to be Kevin Spacey in 7 but failed miserabaly to the point when he became laughable but at least he made some effort and i give him the credit for that and oh boy here we come to the least convincing or i must say ( totally miscast) Rami Malek . he did no effort to bring his character to life . bland ; 0 emotion and 0 presence on the screen .Bring a 4th grade actor and he would have done a better job than he did or just get rid of his character and you will miss nothing .and for the script . well nothing original or creative about it . just take the best hints of some Fincher crafted thrillers ( Se7en- Zodiac - Mindhunter ) .Throw them into the mix with one of the most banal and frustrating endings to date . with characters doing illogical decisions to drive the plot forward and you will get whats all the movie about .I must say that i enjoyed the captivating cinematography by John Schwartzman which brought the vibes of the 1990s and the score by Thomas Newman which was right on the target . but all of these elements went up in the smoke due to the lack of originality and cliched writing .All in all . Despite the talented cast the movie had nothing new to add to this genre . if you expect a gritty crime thriller with captivating characters and masterful storytelling you will be disppointed .,3.0,2287
Astropleb, Almost a 7,"Remi Malek looks like a sick Michelle Rodriguez this guys face is so... ""unique"" looking that its hard to watch sometimes.Remi might be miscast but he plays his character well. He has the perfect face for an up-all-night hacker ala Mr. Robot or a creepy weirdo killer/stalker but its kind of hard to take him seriously as a strait-laced up-and-coming detective.All right putting Remi aside for one moment Denzel does his usual thing and I enjoyed it Jared Leto felt like Joker before the vat and I was okay with it for the character he was playing. The chemistry between Remi and Denzel was okay nothing special.The attempt at a slow burn was good I think it worked on some levels but missed the mark at some point. It became really noticeable that the slow burn was losing me when I started to nod off at about the 1 hour 40 mark (also the point it dropped from 7 to 6). There are some editing issues that bugged me a little but nothing too serious. Had I paid theatre prices I wouldnt be happy but for staying at home this will do I guess.Personally I see this movie as a momentary blip something that couldve been great only to be let down by some slightly off creative choices. The ending was not something I found to be profound either I can see what the writers attempting but personally it fell flat. I wont recommend this movie to anyone wont think about it after this review and I wont talk about it. A blip on the radar.I think any rating between 4 & 8 is justified and can be considered as coming from an objective reviewer anything above or below is probably not free of bias.",6.0,2288

avelrodriguez98," Like the main characters, you should pay attention to the little things.","I am amazed at how much I can pay attention to the films Im watching and pick up on thedetails that make up the central theme. Im not gonna pretend like Im the most knowledgablebut I am going to give my POV on what I think this movie is trying to say.Ill start with Deacon (Denzel Washington) who has a reputation in Los Angeles recognizednoticably by Baxter (Rami Malek) who is a rookie detective. So the two of them begincollaberating on a case involving murdered female victims by a sadistic man.In a bar Baxter raises the question and Im paraphrasing ""Why do cops obsess on a casethey are working on well beyond 5+ years while everyone else has moved on??"" Deaconcouldve continued on the case longer but the crimes stopped when the culprit movedto another town. Outside his jurisdiction and into someone elses.One understanding is that you should never obsess over a case. Move on. The other sideof that is that if you obsess and play the sick games of the culprit you might wind upmaking a fatal mistake. Deacon accidentally kills a missing victim who startled him in thewoods and Baxter kills Sparma (Jared Leto) who was annoying the heck out of him.That is why it would be much easier to move on. Im explain why that is in the confinesof this story in a bit.But yeah move on and dont stoop to the level of a criminal to solve a crime. When dealing witha sick man like Sparma you move on or risk letting him get to you with his minds games and youmake a fatal mistake.Its a tough pill to swallow.Moving on wouldve been easier in this story for one main reason. Sparma is a crime enthusiast. He meets Baxter and says he is a fan of his work. Basically Sparma is the type of guy who would watch Law & Order and take notes. The culprit in each episode is caught because of the details he or she missed that the police detectives catch on to. As Deacon puts it ""The Little Things"".Its because of that reason that Sparma who basically mastered the act of covering up his tracks so much so that connecting evidence to him is 100% impossible that he gets away with his crimes; and I do thinkthat Sparma is 100% the culprit for that reason.Evidence is conclusive. Sparma owning a CB radio means nothing. At one point Baxter has forced Sparmato take him to the body of a missing persons case. DOA. Supposedly buried out in the middle of nowhere.Baxter has allowed himself to be sucked into Sparmas mind games. Which is why Baxter kills him with the shovel.Sparma is calm the whole time because since he is really good at paying attention to the Little Details in his crimes he has no need for killing Baxter and he knows Baxter is not going to find anything anyways and tomorrow hes gonna go back to work. He even says that as I paraphrase ""Can we get this over with. I got work tomorrow.""Deacon who followed Sparma and Baxter to ""the scene of the crime"" sees what Baxter did and helps him cover it up while desposing of the evidence. Because of their built relationship Deacon sees that Baxter will become like him in the future if he continues to obsess. Deacon knows that Baxter will be haunted by the innocent victims he let down. Just like Deacon in his own weird way.If Im right I dont think it was all for nothing and Im sure itll show in the future anyways if the killings stop. I do think Sparma was the culprit there was just no evidence tying him to the crimes.In the end it is safe to assume that Baxter does move on. Again this is just my baseline understanding. I do think some threads are thrown away or not touched on much. Like the young girl in the prologue who reappears again much later and is just gone again soon after.If you pick up on those details if Im on to something you might be fascinated by this movie quitel likeI was.",8.0,2290
niels-dekker, Skip after opening scene,The opening scene is the only little thing about this movie that is actually worth while. Gripping and catching.

bankofmarquis, 3 strong actors elevate this above mediocrity,"Generally when a movie is ""dumped"" in January it is a sure sign of a bad film filled with Liam Neeson kicking butt or CGI monsters attacking a small group of survivors in an isolated location but these being times that they are Warner Brothers release of THE LITTLE THINGS simultaneously in Movie Theaters and on HBO MAX gave me reason to change my thinking.And...Im glad I did for THE LITTLE THINGS is an intriguing mystery with 3 very strong actors going toe-to-toe with each other.Written and Directed by John Lee Hancock (THE BLIND SIDE) THE LITTLE THINGS stars the great Denzel Washington as a former L.A. Detective (now a Sherriff in some small town) who returns to L.A. and teams up with his hot shot replacement (Rami Malek) to track down a serial killer (the main suspect being Jared Leto).It is a moody atmospheric piece with Hancock taking his time telling the story he wants to tell in the way he wants to tell it letting this trio of Oscar winning actors take over the story while he creates interesting moody pictures/scenarios/scenes.And...this approach mostly works. 2 time Oscar winner Denzel Washington as you can imagine is terrific as Joe ""Deke"" Deacon a cracker-jack Detective that is living with some demons from his last case in L.A.. He is in 90% of the scenes in this film and he is more than capable of carrying this film through some pretty slow and sloggy scenes.I would love to say that Oscar winner Rami Malek is equal to the task of playing against Washington and keeping the middle part of this film interesting - but he just isnt. Not to say that Malek is bad - he is very good. He just isnt as good as Washington and the chemistry between these two characters was just not all that strong.That said...without spoiling anything...Malek has a scene at the end of this film where he is TERRIFIC and shows that he is a VERY VERY good actor.The wild card in this film is Oscar winner Jared Leto as the prime suspect in this case - and he is more than up to the task. As is often the case in these sorts of film (think David Finchers SEVEN) Leto does not show up in full force until about 2/3 of the way through the film and that is too bad for he creates sparks on the screen the moment he enters the proceedings and the 3 way interrogation scene between these 3 Oscar winners is Im sure what drew all 3 of these performers to this project and is the best thing in the film.The praise and the criticism of this film must fall on Writer/Director Hancock for he was smart enough to cast these 3 actors and direct them well while also falling prey to falling in love too much with the script and atmosphere he created to the detriment of the film. He could have used someone telling him to speed things up.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",7.0,2292
leosortini, Amazing performances that makes something out of nothing,Thanks to the masters of acting and honestly a really clean cinematography that recall the clean hands of Ang Lee. Bring us to a noir LA lost in time and where time is lost in LA. Probably one of the best character for Jared Leto where he can express his deep emotions.

mfvincent-83239, I really wanted to like it!,Unfortunate. Dialogue between actors is so poorly written and also the cuts in the 1/2 of the movie are so quick and so unnatural when characters are speaking it really stuck out and just felt weird. I get the whole premise of the movie of the characters cant figure out who the killer is and the frustration the have is similar to how detective work is blah blah blah. Denzel and Ramis characters are linked with crimes they have committed by the end of the movie but who cares! The characters arent fleshed out and they are written poorly (almost as written as bad as this review). I did like the cinematography at some parts but at other times nothing stuck out.

Denzel is involved with the case because of personal reason one that has lasted 5 years and the case has striking similarities to one of his cases.

If you like detective thrillers and if you like great actors performance you must to watch this movie.,7.0,2300
Delrvich, A slow burning noir,Was really slow but kept me interested till the end. Bravo.,9.0,2301
mikeytron, Good but....,This was a longer movie. Great cast and acting but a terrible ending. Everything was going well until the end. I guess the writer tried to twist us. Sorry not good. Unfortunately it was building in a great direction and crescendo then fizzled. Plus never truly explained...only partially.This wasnt an acting failure however at the end directing and story twist. Sometimes when a story twists like that there are ooos and aaas well not here!,7.0,2302
gabetheman-11058, Pretty Good,This movie was pretty good. It wasnt great but it wasnt bad. The directing and soundtrack in my opinion is the only thing bad about this movie. The story was very entertaining to follow the acting especially with Jared Leto was incredible. It may leave you clueless in the movie but it ties together well. If you are clueless at the end of the movie then you missed the entire point. Give this movie a watch and keep an open mind at the end.,7.0,2303
immortalmachine-07969, Not your typical crime thriller,This film is about leaving behind preconceptions. In the movie The Little Things the story takes you in directions you expect to go but often in The Little Things its the journey & destination to where you are going is more real than the story would account. The Little Things isnt a clichÃ© thriller its a visceral snap shot of reality.,8.0,2304
itsoclock-18178, The trailer is a huge disservice to this film,"The trailer plays up this movie as a thrilling crime movie with maybe a trial at the end with some action in it. However the actual movie is much more toned down there really isnt any action in at all and there is no trial.This movie is a slow burn it is meant to draw you into the ""action"" of detective work studying a case surveying a possible serial killer. If you are coming into this movie expecting played up action with a clear-cut killer and lots and lots of proof against them and everything written out in plain text just for you to understand it this is not the movie for you and if you watch it be prepared to leave a 1/10 star review; however if you know what you are getting into if you really like crime dramas that are very realistic with no movie magic or the movie playing up the scene to make it high stakes at all times you will probably like it.",8.0,2305

rezanowbari," Interesting Storyline, Great Acting",The Little Things has a very interesting story which evolves with new details adding to the anticipation of the end and the opening new insights into the characters and their unique features.The acting is very interesting with Denzel Washington on a great performance. However there are shades of the characters in previous films of Denzel in this character as well. The story could have done a better job with creating the characters with certain more details regarding their past which directly influence their present status. There are a lot of points left for the viewer to infer about the characters and these inferences may or may not be accurate.The movie is truly entertaining with great performance by all the cast.,7.0,2310
qstiumnh, Wait for it.....Wait for it,"I didnt expect to like this movie based on how slow it started. But as it developed I saw a more realistic portrayal of what the life of a dogged detective is like. My wife and I gave it the same 8 rating because of how unique the ending is. Not a cute fairy tale ending like most ""gritty"" crime movies sometimes depict. Its a movie thatll have you rethinking everything in the prior 2 hours.",8.0,2311
andkpearson-40177, Engaging film,I saw some good and bad reviews but decided to watch because I love Denzel. The interesting thing about this film is that its kind of slow throughout but kept my attention where this two hour movie felt like it was 30 minute long. I believe this was because the character development throughout was so good. The casting and acting were phenomenal. This movie will not spoon feed you everything so some things are going to be open to your interpretation. I believe the intent of this movie is to help remind you to pay attention to the little things in your life and let the past die with the past. Dont hold onto past mistakes. You have a lot of life ahead of you so move forward be grateful for what you have and do your very best with whatever time you have left.,8.0,2312
vato7959, I had to take a shower after this movie Thank You,This was billed as a crime thriller and that is exactly what you got.Thank you for being true to the crime thriller movie genre.Its a great movie iike LA Confidential and the Noir crime films of the 40s and 50sThe TV crime shows are too easy to figure out and TV gives you closure.Real Life does not have a beginning or end you just wake up to another day.FYI : This movie is not for young people nobody turns into a vampire or zombie in this movie.This is an adult movie for someone with a brain.Again thank you for great crime movieThis is the future of story based movies.Thank you HBO Max Apple TV and Netflix,8.0,2313
Loptimus06, The Little Things Review,While The Little Things may not be anything of much memoria it still has a substantially good amount of worth as a piece of psychologically thrilling entertainment. The film shares much of its familiarity with the 1995 movie Se7en. Directed by John Lee Hancock The Little Things follows two cops Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington) a cop haunted by his past and cases he could not solve and Jim Baxter (Rami Malek) as they investigate a chain of murders in 1990s Los Angeles and increasingly fixate their attention on Albert Sparma (Jared Leto) a suspect who seems to enjoy their attention. Its only by around the end of the first hour that Jared Letos character Albert Sparma is brought into the picture. Throughout the runtime the film insists that its the little things that are important and conveys a theme that everybody has skeletons in their closet. The opening credits of the movie also introduces a new Warner Bros logo animation.The performances in the movie are nothing too memorable but are still good. With a cast led by notable Academy Award winners Denzel Washington Rami Malek and Jared Leto. The performances are supported by the script written by John Lee Hancock. The story of the movie is good and with turns at almost every corner it is another area in which the film has success. Although at its loss the story leaves some areas of the film concealed from the audience. The Little Things will leave you at the edge of your seat in the films most thrilling parts. The ending shifts from audience expectations and into a different structure than other films of the same genre and type.The score of the film composed by Thomas Newman is great and however does not assist in giving much of a thrilling aspect alongside the films already existent thrill that is primarily occurrent in the opening and the ending. At the end of the movie the score does assist with the thrill shown on screen. The lighting helps to set the ambiance of the films 1990s Los Angeles setting with many dim and dark lights. These elements keep the tone fitting for the genre of a Drama Crime Thriller film.Overall The story of the film explores many areas of the film and to its loss leaves many areas of the film undisclosed. The score is great but does not give much in terms of a thrill. The performances in the film are also good but they are nothing too special or memorable. These elements help to keep the thrilling storytelling and entertainment aspect of the movie at a somewhat large quality there is nothing that is of amazing quality. I would rate this movie a 7.5/10. The Little Things is available to watch on HBO Max with a subscription from January 29th to February 28th and is also available to watch in theaters.,7.0,2314
liapetrich, Great movie !,"I dont t get all the bad reviews at all. Its a non popcorn movie for sure with the great actors . Really well directed and well played and the filming is absolutely brilliant . It has the same kind of vibe as ""true detective"".If you need action then this movie is not for you.And if you want something to think about and dont mind slow narrative then this would be a good movie for you.",9.0,2315
varminttank, Awesome movie amazing ending,What can I say this movie was awesome. Good story good ending good actors.. It is slow but slow always cooks up better.. Denzel the beast Washington is always good at his part.. man check it out if you like cop suspension thriller style movies.. detective work at its best in my opinion,9.0,2316
FatDumbAmerican, Huge letdown....,A: Although Rami looks like the son of Michael Shannon hes a horrible actor....B: Are Leto and Denzel both wearing pillows under their shirts? Whats up with that? Why would they agree to do this? They cant be that hard up for money. C: This movie sucks. Thats all.,2.0,2317
valentinionut, mild intense,Two cops a young cop and a veteran chase a serie of murders suspecting without court hold evidence a guy that seems to always escape them but giving em enought proof just to feed that cop instinct.Jared L. transforms his appearance but not in the shallow ways he did in other movies.Denzel W. does a decent job.Malek is also ok in this one.The thrill is real but beware.Enterteining.,7.0,2318
ryantimmins, Slow and suspenseful with unresolved details,"I kept seeing ads for this movie thinking that it was going to be a modern ""Se7en"" and this film also has a semi-all star cast of Oscar winning actors. Knowing these facts I expected a pretty decent crime thriller.During the movie I felt that it was going nowhere. That was until Jared Letos character appeared. When we are introduced to his character the film began to pick up its pace. Rami malek was not as his best by far but Denzel was great as always. The editing was not great either as there werent many scenes that felt rushed as it did not give us time to really take in what was being presented to us.John Lee Hancock has been known to make great historical films such as the blind side and the founder. I feel that this crime thriller was not his forte.This was an enjoyable film however just had multiple flaws and did not have much of an impact on me like ""Se7en"".",6.0,2319
chrisandmark-44838, Brilliant - Old School Detective Movie,If like me your a fan of the 90s mystery detective thriller that requires no CGI or special effects or other modern day movie magic effects then The Little Things is for you.Its a shame that Hollywood appears to have has lost its faith in scripts like this one. The Little Things offers up a taste of the old school with its simple but effective plot that doesnt pretend to be anything that its not. The acting and dialogue is intelligent subtle and effective. Denzel Washington Rami Malek and Jared Leto all bring to the table a absorbing masterful and truthful performances that really help bring a sense of long forgotten class to the movie.The sub-plot that explores the past events of Washingtons character for me felt a little off but was well explained as it subtly drifts in and out of the movie as more and more is added leading to it tying nicely together with the main plot. I personally loved the 90s Jagged Edge style twist at the end that although isnt earth shattering its fun and commendable.The Little Things is a gripping and subtly tense movie that serves us commendable performances and a very well done simple but intelligent good guy vs bad guy plot.Solid Entertainment and heres me thinking they dont make them like that anymore but after watching The Little Things.....Im glad to see they do!,9.0,2320

brett-76260, decent but...,Overall the movie is good... The editing is kind of shotty and it jumps around a bit much but other than that a pretty good movie. Acting is decent but story is nothing original. Youve seen other movies like it before no question about it. but in the end its probably worth watching. There are far worse movies to watch than this one thats for sure. I think the rating would fall anywhere from 6-7 for the majority of people...,7.0,2322
ali-najafyi, garbage writing,"The writing is unbelievably bad. There is no pace to the story and its not even an attempt at suspense its just the writer not knowing how to develop a story.No character depth or development. It gets worse as the movie goes on. You can not believe what you are watching is this bad because it has Denzel Washington in it!The directing dialogues scenery are absolute trash and completely fail in the task of making you engage in what you are watching instead of thinking who funded this amateur project?The acting is terrible as well Rami Malek is not believable as a grown man let alone a competent police detective. And Jared Leto!! do I need to say anything?one hour into the movie you will be like ""why did Denzel disrespected his own career by participating in this garbage?!""",1.0,2323

ted-sammons, Familiar and predictable but with good acting,Meh it was worth a 7 for the acting. The plot and storyline are familiar and little predictable. Rami misses the mark at times but Denzel and Leto fit like puzzle pieces. Cinematography and score are worth the 7 stars if not more.,7.0,2325
arod_85," Good, but should have been great","The movie was interesting and unlike other reviews I thought the ending was great. Many reviews have said the ending did not work with the movie or the ending fell short. The problem was not the ending but the rest of the movie. With a cast like Washington Leto and Malik the movie should have been a home run and as far as acting goes it was (though Malik was awkward at times). The story needed much more thrilling moments to be considered a ""psychological thriller"". The pacing and thrilling moments were just too slow. Leto was great as a suspected sociopath however the movie significantly underutilized him. I would have liked to see Leto taunting the police more often through his actions more clues alluding to him being the killer and the frustration continuing to mount with Washington and Malik from knowing they have caught the killer yet cant do a thing about it. That would have made the ending so much more satisfying or understood when Maliks character finally ""lost it"" with Letos character. Overall I wouldnt call it a loss but I dont think its a movie I would watch again...Leto needs another opportunity to play a sadistic psychopath in the future because he played the character wonderfully. Denzel was Denzel always strong.",7.0,2326
ebeckstr-1, Very solid suspense drama,I think the people who are giving this movie low ratings were expecting some kind of a high octane crime thriller or a pulse pounding psycho killer flick. Instead what we have is a slow burn psychological drama character driven rather than plot driven.The movie is extremely well cast and acted with an unexpectedly affecting score. In fact the score is one of the films greatest strengths and is an excellent track in its own right something that I will be seeking out on Spotify.I gather that a fair number of reviewers didnt like the ending and I have to wonder if some of them just didnt get it or were again expecting some sort of action ending. Thats just not the kind of movie this is. Highly recommended if you are a patient viewer enjoy a lower key kind of suspense and appreciate theme and character-centered movies.,7.0,2327
cenmail, Really good; wouldn't call the ending ambiguous,"I though the movie was really good. The music and sound editing were great. Someone picked apart the visual editing as having too many cuts-I didnt feel this way at all and that sort of thing usually annoys me.Great acting by Denzel and Leto. Im still not sold on Ramy... but Ive only seen him in Mr Robot. Not sure I bought him as a detective. His demeanor is a little strange. But it didnt affect my opinion of the movie at all.The plot and ending to me was straight forward and good. Denzels character was a great detective he became obsessed with a case he couldnt solve and it caused him to eff up. He happens upon a new case with same MO and its a chance to nail the killer. Ramy effs up too Denzel helps him ""deal with it.""I think that the writers editors and director did their best to insinuate that Letos character was indeed the killer... even though there may never have been enough forensic evidence to hold up in court.The ending did leave me thinking... and after thinking about it I was quite satisfied.",8.0,2328
iamjamalwhite, best movie so far this year,This is a good movie. It reminded me of an old fashion crime story. I liked the old cars and the way secrets were slowly revealed as we went on. Took the whole family and we enjoyed watching it. Denzel deserves another Oscar.,7.0,2329
magatsu, Ho hum run of the mill homicide detective movie,Big stars bad writing boring film. Uninspired and often meaningless conversation spoken by boring characters.,1.0,2330
Opinate, Tight little film with great acting but a miscast in Malek. Almost a 7.,A good characterful slow burn standard fare cop movie if you like character over action and dont expect a great twist at the end. Washington and Leto give solid at times exceptional performances and it is worth a watch just for those.The only weak link is the miscast of Rami Malek. His character seemed to be a pale imitation of Guy Pearces character from LA Confidential in the beginning (without having the chops to pull it off) but his character quickly morphed into a sidekick-type to Denzels much stronger lead and eventually a patsy to Letos.There wasnt a real character arch to show why he had the sudden change so it seems unnatural. His acting was cheesy and more caricature than character.I have enjoyed Malek in several productions but think he is much better as a creepy nerdy type not a leading man. He completely ruined Bohemian Rhapsody for me with his limp performances and constant teeth sucking. I hope to see him cast more to his type in the future because honestly much as I like him I dont think he is a great actor but is effective as a creep. In this film his performance looked a little pathetic next to the great Denzel Washington and also Leto.,6.0,2331
michellegeller, Storyline just OK. Incredible acting!,Jared Letos performance stands out in this film. Of course Denzel and Rami are also great but not theyre top performances.,7.0,2332
david_royz, Needed more Jared Leto,The premise was simple and interesting with some clever plot lines and a somewhat unpredictable ending. But you do need to ignore a few conveniences and stupid character behaviour.It takes a little too long to get going and drags in a few places. Jared Leto is amazing and menacing as the key suspect and he deserved a little more screen time.Denzel is great as always but Rami seems miscast.The 1990 setting allowed for imperfect forensics and no cellular phones. But it felt more of a distraction and perhaps a modern day setting couldve been achieved quite easily.,6.0,2333
eddy-59618, Thank God,"A decent film with very good actors the incomparable Denzel Washington and Rami Malek thank God at last a film that is not lecturing us or whining about something or other just entertainment its about time far far too many ""Woke"" films and they are a big turn off.",9.0,2334
Nightmarelogic, Actors elevate an average script,"While not especially original this is still a very good cop murder mystery/thriller and good for HBO Max. I probably wouldnt have enjoyed it as much in the theaters but sitting at home it was a good thriller police movie with top notch actors that smoothed out any of the flaws. Of course there is nothing particularly new in this. But there is nothing wrong with that. Anyone who has seen any of the past police thrillers that came before this most notably ""Seven"" can guess how this will go. But its the actors themselves that make it worth watching.",7.0,2335

skp-43271," Crime, drama, thriller . . .","The theme of crime drama thriller can be the best but the genre has been overused repeatedly. Some do a good job but the reality dramas that ramble on for 30 minutes about how the victim was the life of the party everyones pal she/he would ""light up the room"". those I can do without and this movie might have fallen into that trap without Denzel Washington. Still it was interesting and had some good variations. There may not be another ""Seven"" movie that comes along for who knows how long. Regarding the characters Rami Malek has never been in my top 20 but he is riding high on his portrayal of Mercury. For me in this film the miscast was off-putting.",7.0,2337
benjaminlauriesmith, I rated it 7 for a reason,I think if you have never seen the movie 7 then you will enjoy the ending a lot more. Its not that the ending of this movie is bad because it isnt and its something Ive never seen before and wasnt expecting. What I was expecting was a jaw dropping 7 esk type reveal and ending but we didnt get that. Then again if I wanted to see that shouldnt I just watch 7 again and if it had have ended like that it would most likely got slated for being a 7 copy.I thougroughly enjoyed the movie right up to the ending which having thought about it is only disappointing because Id built it up in my mind to be a 7 type movie ending which it wasnt and it wasnt the ending where Denzel arrives just in time to save his partner and it wasnt the ending where the baddie takes the cop by surprise and the gun goes off leaving you to wonder whos alive until the reveal but then they have all been done before and this is an ending Ive never seen before but is it an ending I would have chosen given the choice? Well....No. Sometimes its just nice to have another slice of cake even though you know what it tastes like.The other problem with the movie is that it leaves you with a question about what the movie was actually about. Was it in fact a movie made in era of high tension with the police in the US about police corruption and the murder of an innocent man or was he and even if you decide upon that you are still left with the corruption issue.The problem is that the main suspects guilt is ambiguous enough for you to question the motives and moral right or wrong of the cops. If this was a Dirty Harry movie you wouldnt even bat an eyelid at the ending just cheer along as the cop who breaks the rules to get the bad guy gets it done again.There are also numerous issues that spring up with the events of the ending. Getting in the car with the murder suspect and digging holes while he walks around you with you gun inches away from him?A character that up to this point has been cool calm and collected breaks character after a single provedation and kills the suspect with a single swing of the shovel?They then decide to commit a major felony with the possibility of getting caught when he simply says the suspect grabbed his gun and he swung the spade and hit him. There are no witnesses and all they need do is place the gun in his hand after a brief investigation its justifiable self defence and a lot easier to cover up than burying a body which could be found and taking the risk of cleaning an apartment and a car. The FBI are now carrying out an investigation in the area. It would also have fitted with the fact they covered up the earlier accidental killing.So the ending has issues and its easy to see why people have been voting this lower than what you might expect.Its not a 1 as some Muppets have been putting and its not a 10 for most people. I think your expectations and past movie experience will determine how you rate the movie.It does also lead to some interesting discussions about what the writer and director were aiming to bring to the screen. Is it a politically motivated agenda piece aimed at corruption in the police or is it a morally driven movie about the grey lines in life and what people are willing to live with.,7.0,2338
Sophia-Jones, The dark side of detectives.,Crazy! I liked it and Im saddened by it. Great job by all of the cast. Im blown by the creativity and by Denzels character. This movie shows how a case can eat away at your soul and turn you into someone you never thought youd be. Make you do things you never thought youd do. This movie was tough...someone being harassed because of their appearance shot first questions later and toying with the cops. Damn!,7.0,2339
fmatt-88980," ""The Little Things"" needed something big",Its hard not to like a Denzel Washington movie. Especially a movie that has two Academy Award winners in it-say Rami Malek. This extra slow burn crime drama did nothing to enhance the image of Policemen. And whats more the crimes are never solved. Director John Lee Hancocks handling of this sad tale was commendable but the script took the viewer on a road to nowhere. This tome was certainly not worth going to a theater and dropping $10-plus popcorn and drinks on. It was disappointing. But a good reason to have HBO Max so you dont throw away any more money than is absolutely necessary. By the way Jared Leto was perfect as the non-bad guy.,7.0,2340

While Denzel Washington and Jared Leto were excellent I thought Rami Malek was a bit tepid. The ending is both ambiguous and satisfying. I imagine a large percentage of people who watch this film will feel cheated but I thought the conclusion was appropriate. Not a modern-era crime classic like ""Seven"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" but itll do in these uncertain times...like the clue disclosed in the final minutes ""The Little Things"" could be seen as a sliver of hope that will save some and haunt others.",7.0,2344

chubarova, Good psychological drama,This film leaves a very contradictory feeling. On the one hand it should be a detective story and the film sincerely tries to be one while having a large number of plot holes and strange moments. But on the other hand the focus of the story is clearly shifted towards a psychological drama about the police. Secondly the cast is simply amazing and the film is partly based only on the three main actors. In short this is a good film about the psychology of police officers.,8.0,2348

josephbrewster-88279, An unpleasant experience in (mostly) all the right ways,This is a hard review to write because I cant say I liked this movie but I dont think this movie was made to be liked which is a testament to the effectiveness of the execution. It was well done if unsatisfying and plays on the anxiety and dizziness of ambiguity. It rides this anxiety into the credits which may leave more than a few moviegoers feeling cheated of the tidy package they expected from a brooding crime drama.I went in knowing nothing except the cast which is my preference and was content to judge the film on against a blank slate of expectations. Denzel gave a subdued every-man performance with palpable sincerity. As Deacon he commanded the screen in a quiet repressed emotionality indicative of a seasoned actor. Malek was a suitable counterpart mirroring a younger version of the weathered Deacon. The chemistry was ok between them but the acting did feel flat and tedious at times matching the doldrums of their stakeout and beat work. In terms of pacing very little crime is on-screen. This is not the realm of heated car chases shootouts or gut-wrenching murder scenes. Think CSI with added helpings of cafe dialogue and meaningful looks.Am I making It sound long and tiring? It is. Which wouldnt normally be how Id describe a good movie and yet this machine was built for a reason and overall I think it does its job properly. Its built to make you question. Not just elementary whodunnit questions but deep existential wrestling against the dark specter of the unknown-of uncertainty. After all why are we drawn to mystery as a genre? Uncertainty is alluring and the thrill of the reveal brings a profound sense of satisfaction. The good guys triumph the secret is made known the disaster is averted. Here is where this film takes a sharp departure from the norm and to its credit.As the plot rolled along I felt the writers were stirring up more questions than the runtime would allow them to properly explore. We were handed two main characters ostensibly noble but internally conflicted. Driven by a sense of righteous duty they relentlessly pursue the evil even when it requires taking the law into their own hands (which lets be real pretty much every hero from Sherlock Holmes to James Bond does with shocking regularity). Their efforts should pay off. Their digging should unearth the truth. Thats how reality should be. Neat tidy orderly and fair.And isnt that what we all want? The same as what these two obsessed detectives are risking their lives and sanity for: truth. Certainty. Closure. Is that so much to expect?Its a lot to expect actually and while you are right to expect star performances unexpected turns tense encounters and smoky interrogation room episodes be careful about those expectations. We dont always get what we want. We dont always see the truth. The world doesnt always right itself of wrong.And so neither does this film. Nevertheless it is a stirring commentary on how our obsession to know to be right and to find closure can lead us into dark and dangerous territory where the odd serial killer may not be the greatest threat to our health and home.,8.0,2351
gjfrost, Great movie and acting; poor editing,"Spoiler alert.I really enjoyed the movie. Great acting and a good story if the confusion or vagueness left out. I had to rewind the movie to make sure of these points.The ""nice boots"" mentioned then showed briefly on the bed of Deke implied he might be the killer but the beginning scene shows typical brown leather shoes worn by the serial killer. The first scene also shows a non-black mans wrist confirming it was not Deke. More could have been done to really wrap up the movie to make this a 8 or 9 out of 10 movie. I paid HBO a months fee only to see this and Im not disappointed.",7.0,2352

iconians, Who says there is a happy ending...,Very interesting movie. For such a star studded cast we are actually given a fairly straightforward who-dun-it. In the end though we find more than we bargained for and its not what you think it is.I think acting was good but I do feel that editing could be better. There could be some more back story to certain elements. The ex wife scenes were fairly useless.Ending was good but unexpected which is what I like. I do think that Denzel did the right thing for this time but is it really the right thing for all times?If were to go a bit of philosophical here then I would disagree no one gets to be judge jury and executioner no matter how confident one is.If thats not a cautionary tale of this movie nothing else is.7.5/10. I think with better editing it could be 8.5 movie.,8.0,2355
caggianogabe," John Shea's "" Grey Lady"" set in LA","""The Little Things"" is almost exactly the story line of John Sheas "" Grey Lady"" for the first hour until it morphs into "" The Pledge"" the underrated Nicholson film directed by Sean Penn.What lifts this film above "" Grey Lady"" is Denzel Washington understands his characterwhile Eric Dane as the lead cop in a similar circumstance in ""Grey Lady"" clearly did not.Is "" The Little Things"" a great film? Almost. Its an adult film which reinforces life is messy and happy outcomes are often quite subjective. Its a smart film. "" Grey Lady"" was not. I watched this and thought "" John Shea could have been the lead in this"" . As he should have been in "" Grey Lady"". Little things matter. So do the big ones. Which is why "" The Little Things"" is better.",7.0,2356
cristeavirgil1797, A good detective/killer movie,Its not something new but is something we need good performance from all three but Jared Leto make the movie better.No Angels and the little things matter allways that we learn from the movie is a bit longer for what the movie wanted to be the director tried to make it like Zodiac or Se7en but eith not succes i l tell you if you came to watch the movie after seeing one i already mentioned you will be disappointed.Its a movie for a Sunday morning after you wake up and take ur brakefast you will enjoy it if u get along with the case.,7.0,2357

bstilesbs, Little things with little confusion,It was a little confusing how the movie was and with 3 great actors the hype was there but I personally have to watch it more than once because I didnt catch everything the first time like the movie inception.

juuntjuhh," Tribute to Se7en, but it's the little things..",A good detective story with very strong acting from the three male leads. The unlikely duo of Washington and Malek made the movie work for me. I found the story very captivating we followed the frustrating and hard work that goes into solving a murder case. Its not quite an action movie nor a thriller.The plot felt very Se7enish but to me more in a tribute kind of way.THE ONLY THING I COULD NOT WRAP MY HEAD AROUND was the godafwul editing. Especially the first scenes where we meet Washington and Malek. What the f* was that? The breakfast scene was filmed from every possible angle that lasted less than a second.. It was so confusing I had to pause the movie multiple times. Halfway through the movie I got used to this style (if you can call it that)..Otherwise I would have rated this movie a solid 9!,8.0,2361
demi-12," My interpretation of the movie, possible spoilers",Very good movie. I believe this is the first one Ive seen where the story is told with at least one of the detectives being in frame at all times. That is we see the story from their perspective with all the pros and cons this brings. No tips no clues for the viewer - what you see is what you get.We did not see the murderer. The chase in the opening scene was with a blue car but not Dekes Ford. Albert has a green and a yellow car. Plus the guy at the beginning looked nothing like any of them.For me this movie is to show how hard detectives work is and how emotional they can become pursuing the culprit. Some loose ends yes but thats life - not everything makes perfect sense right?,7.0,2362
jonathon-roper, Not to bad!!,Works a lot slower than a typical thriller but plays out nicely with Great performances. Jared Leto is the stand out while Washington and Malek play it somewhat safe but solid. Its a film you have to be in the mood for.,7.0,2363
spywitness, The Little Things was a Warning,"Gritty tale of overworked LA sheriff disgruntled & obsessed with minutiae of cold cases haunted by a few past mistakes. Denzel is marvelous here conjuring up ghosts of ""Seven"". Rami Malek shows portraying pop stars is fluff & boringly miscast as detective hes minus the instincts for ingenious crime solving. Jared Leto is a creepy show stopper you dread his every move! Yet the unrewarded painful evidence combing & stakeouts lead & expose mysteries that all characters share....except Maleks. He seems disjointed & more concerned with personal life. The unraveling of past & present serial murderers involving suspect Leto examines frustration of unsolved crimes & inability to get a conviction. This tale would have benfited as a Series as the details needed more revelation",8.0,2364
beerguy1, Worth the watch,Not the greatest movie ever but we enjoyed it.Give it a chance.,8.0,2365
Mike_Devine, A quintessential throwback crime thriller,"Its been a while since audiences have been treated to a classic procedural crime thriller and The Little Things has filled that void for those of us who have access to HBO Max.If it feels like weve seen this film before its because we have thanks to a very basic plot and linear story flow. The ""washed up old cop teams up with aggressive young detective"" plotline has been done to death but it still makes for an interesting watch if the caliber of the actors is high. Fortunately Denzel Washington and Rami Malek fit that bill well as academy award winning-actors and while the source material isnt stellar they both do a respectable job here. Speaking of academy award winners Jared Leto once again dials up the creep factor as an appliance maintenance guy so theres that.Little is dark heavy and unsettling at times and while not an uplifting film by any means it also has some important takeaways and explores interesting themes including the role of fatherhood and confronting the past. It also serves its intended purpose as a thriller - there are enough twists and turns to make it into a wild ride around LA circa 1990.It wont be remembered as a career highlight for any of its top-billed cast but The Little Things is worth the time if this is one of your favorite genres.",6.0,2366
esminamartins, This movie needs more credit,I see what everyone else is saying okay? But the summary already promised you the Groundhog Day trope. Only its NOT Groundhog Day. This was a completely different ride. Groundhog Day taught us to seize the day. This movies was telling us to look at all the perfect things in a day. Taking away the overused trope this movie was extremely charming in its own way. I recommend it as an easy watch on a tiring day.,7.0,2367

lightheartedbeing, Perfect little Film finding the many tine perfect things,"There are a few things going on in the story and the film that most reviewers are missing. The journey these two end up going on together to reach where they need to go in themselves and with one another has a deeper dimension then it seems. If you surf the surface youll miss it. I dub movies like this ""hospice"" films because facing death is an underlying theme. So yes its also a teenage rom/com coming of age; its also an homage to the now classic Groundhog Day. We dont think about what teenagers deal with -- the serious issues families are challenged by -- this film lets us take a pause to consider that and look for the many tiny perfect things that show up in a day. Its bright and fun sweet and dear innocent and thoughtful sobering and reconciling.",9.0,2377
Her-Excellency, Perfect Simple Little Huge Film,As a cinephile most pictures such as these are too formulaic and way too overdone (at this point) for me. Not to mention that almost each one involves some sort of superhero or villain nowadays and although I very much enjoy that genre also I cant tell you enough how pleased I was to find the treasure which is The Map of Tiny Perfect Things. To find and share with you that it does so much more and more powerfully than what bigger flashier films try with such a small footprint is been beyond delightful.Kyle Allen steals the show as Mark. His easy chemistry with the screen is magic. Kathryn Newton is a little less fluid in her role as Margaret especially at the beginning. The small seldom-seen supporting cast is tremendous.As for the tiny perfect things some indeed are tiny or perhaps not on the level you or I would consider to be perfect. In fact a better definition might be: things that makes us smile and think. In any case the film uses them effectively in that they do indeed bring a smile and we think; and in fact we may miss some if we blink. More so however they are effective in that we cannot help at least for a brief time after watching the film to look for our own.In closing this is a rich yet simple film with deeper undercurrents of love and loss yes but more so beyond being tender and uplifting it is generous in its message that there are miracles around us every single day if we just look a little.,9.0,2378
kjr107," Wonderful, touching move",OK. I admit it. Im a sucker for for a well crafted sci-fi romantic movie. This movie fits that bill. Similar in concept to Groundhog Day where the same day is experienced over and over this movie expands on that theme. It explores one repeating day through the eyes of a young man and draws you into his world. That day continues to repeat itself until suddenly he meets a girl who is having the same repeated day. They hang together and see that day in a new way. Perfect tableaus appearing in front of them for moments through that day. You see these moments just as they see them. Tiny perfect things. You feel their wonder and joy. You feel their heartache. Watch this movie. It will make your day.,9.0,2379

Lockout_Salties," Harmless, but also thoughtless","Im getting so sick of the whole day-keeps-repeating-over-and-over plot line. No movies that I know of have really done anything new with the concept but they at least manage some sense of charm and intrigue. Unfortunately the painfully generic Map of Tiny Perfect Things flounders in that department.The story is pretty much exactly what youd expect. Its so predictable that its entirely unnecessary to put it in this review. Just read the basic premise and title and youve already got a pretty good idea as to where its going.Now that on its own wouldnt be a problem. The similarly predictable Palm Springs managed to be incredibly enjoyable thanks to great performances some funny lines and solid writing. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is just... meh in every department. The performances are serviceable but they arent exceptional. The writing does okay but theres really nothing memorable. And there is but one funny line in the entire movie which inexplicably is said in the middle of what I assume was supposed to be an emotional scene.Additionally the whole film has an aggressive Indie vibe as if every frame is screaming ""WE WERENT MADE BY A BIG MOVIE STUDIO."" This is especially strange considering that it was made by Amazon one of the largest companies in the world. Because of this the whole film has this underlying sense of corporate control that was almost a little eerie. For example it feels like the love interest has a sad backstory not so that the audience can empathize with her but rather because the studio heads say itll make people cry. Honestly this strange tone persisted throughout the movie and I was more than a little uncomfortable with it.Overall the Map of Tiny Perfect Things is harmless and doesnt really have anything horrible in it. Items just so cookie-cutter and bland taking an overdone premise and doing nothing new with it. I suppose it will make for a serviceable movie-watching experience but frankly there are much better time travel movies out there (Safety Not Guaranteed on Netflix Palm Springs on Hulu and Donnie Darko come to mind). The Map of Tiny Perfect Things isnt a horrible way to spend 90 minutes but Im sure most people will have much better things to do with their time.Final Score: 57/100.",5.0,2382
gtmarcyk, Self aware rom-com,"This movie is smart enough to have the characters live in the same world and actually seen the same movies as the audience. So when the young teenager Mark is reliving the same day over and over again he comments ""this is just like Groundhogs Day."" And when Mark describes his temporal abnormality to his video game addicted friend the friend replies ""Oh you mean just like Edge of Tomorrow"".Mark eventually encounters a teenage girl who shares the same temporal abnormality as him. And together they begin to discover and catalogue all the perfect little things that happen repetitively every day in their small town. And predictably Mark begins to fall in love with the only person who shares his life and experiences. Then there is an interesting plot twist played on both Mark and the audience near the end of the film.This is an entertaining take on a well-worn theme and the two young actors do a great job.",9.0,2383

I didnt feel stuck in a time loop viewing it.Its an uplifting movie about appreciating the small things around you that you would usually miss out on by just having a busy life.

rmmil, The dumbing down of America continues,"You know what is an absolutely fantastic film? Groundhog Day. Funny intelligent thought-provoking real feeling characters and a well made plot line.All things missing from this film.You see theres a ""time loop"" and our protagonists are stuck in it. Its a fine pretense but its mostly done in a very dull / ""been there done that"" sort of way like even the characters themselves are mostly unimpressed by the situation they are in.(Hollywood side note: As Im sure its not lost on some people this film shares shocking similarities to a film that came out just about a year before this one ""Palm Springs"" that also has a ""devil may care"" lead woman character and joins the action midstream. Like Dantes Peak and Volcano coming out the same year or Deep Impact and Armageddon apparently the same ""repeating day"" script was floating around Hollywood at the same time.)Much like last years ""Palm Springs"" no attempt is made to cash in on the instant comedy and drama that would be built into someone discovering their day is repeating as it happened instead we join the action midstream like you get the idea theyve been doing this already hundreds of times or more. It helps catch you up on the story quickly but its lazy and the characters seem mostly unphased by it all.Whats even more lazy is when you find out the ""cause"" of the repetition. I wont go into all of it here but It makes zero sense in an already nonsensical plot like is the lead actress just a god or something? Oh wait its because shes ""good at math"". Okay?Anyway the entire plot is actually just an excuse for a very corny teeniebopper cringe romance.I love the concept of time loop films but this one was just absolutely the path of least resistance as if whoever wrote it couldnt be bothered it make sense of it all so they just dont.

matt_hew, The Film of Tiny Plot Holes & Perfect Clichés (6/10),This film is nice... (just nice).It isnt bad it certainly isnt original is full of the typical teen clichés and desperately wants to be more than it is whilst trying to be quaint - an Amazon movie production that wants to be a small indie film.And thats a bit of a problem. It tries soo hard to be original - even when it spends the whole movie commenting on similar movies. The acting is really ropey (sorry) which gets even more cringey when combined with the some (most) of the cheesy narrative.Plot holes are also an issue. The movie tries to be intellectual but as the movie and characters develop the story starts to play fast and loose on the concept of time in order to focus on the relationship between the two lead characters.If you can get past all of this then youll probably enjoy it but you certainly wouldnt want to watch it on repeat ;-),6.0,2412

Spaghetti sauce contains three ingredients yet it is the ratio of those items and possibly the addition of another item that makes it different or more or less enjoyable.The writers and actors of The Map of Tiny Perfect Things didnt create something perfect.

nicolaperrin, Beautifully done,Yes movies of a similar concept have been made before but this one felt unique in its own way. The acting was brilliant and it was all very well done with beautiful backgrounds at times. I did cry I have to admit as my Dad died in hospital from cancer last year and I would have wanted to replay the same day to spend more time with him. That part really touched me.

noahpandalover," Sweet, romantic, and enjoyable movie.",I love time loop movies they make up one of my favourite sub-genres. This was a surprisingly nice fresh take on the trope.The opening sequence is fantastic so much so it would be interesting to watch it with somebody who didnt know this was a time loop film.The two lead performances were good Id be interested in seeing both of them in more stuff in the future.The only reason I refrain from giving it a 9/10 is that it feels like it is over 2 hours. I only looked at the runtime after finishing and was quite surprised to see it is under 100 minutes. The pacing of the film is off it feels a lot longer than it is.Dont get me wrong still very fun movie and I would watch it again but I think the script probably could have gone through one more draft.,8.0,2439

jmn-83551," Acting so modest and grounded that it becomes innovative, and deeply enjoyable.",For a rom com with modest ambitions I found it extremely enjoyable. One reviewer criticized the characters as lacking in flaws but that made it feel more real to me. The characters have flaws but most real life young adults are pretty good people and arent boiling over with so much drama that they end up yelling at each other before kissing each other in a thunderstorm. I think it had more emotional depth for the lack of heightened drama not less and is challenging cinema norms in a very needed way. Not all of film needs to be soap opera and Shakespearian theater. There is a place for grounded portrayal of ordinary people because in the end real life is bigger than our imaginations. When Hollywood is drowning us in fake or cheap drama this has the potential to be revolutionary. I hope it has influence.,9.0,2444
nammage, Time-Loop Love Story,Who gets a haircut and their scalp is perfectly tanned? Who gets $100 bills out of ATMs? How can someone in a constant time-loop not figure out what someone wants when nothing else works? Also if one has been in a time-loop a thousand or more times knows almost every little thing that will happen how difficult is it to find a dog? Its the little things that stick out to people in time-loop films.The cliché of doing a topic over and over again is us inevitably in a time-loop. What I think makes a great love story to watch is the one viewing it becomes enamored with one or both of the characters who is in the love story. Mark (Kyle Allen) is the one we start off with. We see through his daily routine that hes been in the loop for quite awhile so in essence: we learn nothing about him except he has a father in his life a mother that works apparently a lot a younger sister whos on the soccer team and a best friend who he talks to but...theyre all inconsequential to each other because were stuck watching his carefree life. Theres no tribulation. Then enters Margaret (Kathryn Newton) who apparently may have been in the time-loop just as long as Mark but thats the impression and she still seems to have her wits about her even if she acts a little too carefree and how they only just ran into each other in a seemingly small town where they go to the same school per sé?50 minutes in I was expecting something anything and the build up is there but nothing. I didnt care about the characters because one doesnt really learn anything about them to care anything about them. What kind of people are they? Whats the emotional pull for us to them? None of this is shown until the last 20-30 minutes and by then...who cares? Time is a human invention. It can mean something. Everything important in this film is in the last 25 minutes; we were only seeing his life and not hers. One may attach themselves to him by the end but the character of Margaret just seemed like fodder up to that point and that doesnt make a love story whether Margarets love for Mark or for her mother. We should have gotten more of Margarets story except in the last 15-20 minutes. But then that was the entire point of the film.Did it work?,7.0,2445

jasminelavann, Truth time,"Okay so just because I didnt like it doesnt mean you Wont.If you are looking for something sweet and heartwarming watch this. But if you are looking for something actually different do not watch. In my opinion this movie is nothing special. They are trying way to hard to make the girl character "" quirky"" and "" unique"" shes nice but shes the definition of the kind of girl producers try to make when they try to make that one girl look "" quirky and different"" The storyline is basic and nothing new. I understand the message is super sweet and inspirational to find the perfect things in my life. But in my opinion they chose the wrong characters for this. My idea of what the concept in that topic should be is to find the unexpected even in the expected. And the fact is you could pull a guy and a girl like him from any basic highschool and force them to see the "" beautiful in life"" and they would all act the same. Plus the romance is basically forced because the guy really wanted to meet someone and he could have met any girl who was cute or "" quirky"" and been like I like you. And thats not unique or different at all. Because without the loop it would have just been like those basic highschool movies where the "" different girl"" meets the nice but hot guy. The only slightly unique thing is the idea of trying to find the perfect things in life but its delivered in such a basic way with a basic cast.Please please do better this is not different .",3.0,2452

wangbofd, The sweetest and most heart-touching time loop movie.,"The sweetest and most heart-touching time loop movie I have ever watched. I would highly recommend it it is like a hot chocolate for a cold night warms you up from toe to teeth.There have been so many of stuck-in-a-day time loop movie almost one every year. And I have watched many of them. But this is so far the sweetest one for me. It is more than just a time loop story but also a story of 2 teenagers trying to find the meaning of lives discovering themselves trying to do good the people around them and also most importantly to fall in love with each other. Beyond that it is also a ""day"" for them to discover their love for friends families and strangers. Instead of making pranks making money or taking advantage of people they choose to help people and trying to make the world a better place with some mild fun along the way. Just like the title says it is the tiny perfect things that make our life a wonderful place.

Keeping our kids quiet during even their own choice of movie is generally impossible but ""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things"" kept the whole family -- ages 46 44 13 10 & 7 -- more-or-less silently entranced throughout.

CinemaSerf, Better than average teen movie...,"OK so we too have seen it all before - but this features quite an engaging effort from Kyle Allen ""Mark"" who repeats the same day over and over with his family. He encounters ""Margaret (Katheryn Newton) who is also suffering from the same repetitive scenario and they realise that nothing they do will not be undone next day and so have some fun together. Of course they begin to fall in love but she has reservations; steals away every day at the same time and despite his best efforts - and a cleverly concocted map depicting their daily routines - it looks like they are doomed to this groundhog day existence for ever.... What can break their curse? Both the leads are easy on the eye; Allen looks like he might have a musical theatre background as his movements are frequently quite rhythmically synchronised and the pair take this rehashed theme along for about 45 minutes well enough before it too begins to recycle itself. Its young persons film with cute stars. a little bit of chemistry and a modicum of gentle humour as they try to escape their circle of life. It wont be a film we will watch or remember a year from now probably but for now its a perfectly watchable family television feature.",6.0,2486
sogoodlooking," Offensive tripe, a needless, unrewarding feminist subversion of Groundhog Day","After the first terrific 10 minutes the film falters significantly. Kathryn Newton isnt attractive enough to pique our interest or serve as a credible romantic prize which is where these things always.Theyre sexless as well. They could be any gender.The girls ignorance is on an essential point is unintentional. Why would one assume that what theyre dealing with is in any way Euclidean? She claims that time is not the fourth dimension when according to Einsteinian spacetime which superceded the Euclidean time is indeed the fourth dimension and theres no reason to think this repetition is only occurring on some Euclidean scale.Then she misunderstands the representation of a fourth spatial dimension treating it as a very real thing then as a kind of metaphor which is not unreasonable but it ultimately makes no sense.The search for perfect things is okay but its gotten a bit dull and were only 33m in and hes in the process of trying to ""win"" the girl as if she was the what mattered. Ugh.""Its all I got. Take it or leave it."" Way to be a piece of crap. And like a weakling he mumbles hell accept it. How can boys grow up sanely when this garbage is all they see day in day out?At the midpoint of the run time hes at his nadir having made an incredible series of moves that only resulted in a flat and even insulting rejection.The script blunders with an unpleasant exchange between the lead and Al Madrigal who brings nothing to the role of a needlessly irritated algebra teacher. Why not get a very talented comedian to play the role and shoot for something like a scene between Bill Murray and Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky). With this one theyre not even trying.So he ends up interpreting all this as she made me a better man and that his own life isnt even his story and were supposed to believe this is personal progress. Then we get ridiculous wisdom from her mother whos dying of cancer. ""Its never too late unless youre dying of cancer."" Spare me your delusional American fantasy of hope.Its the horror of contemporary feminism writ small but then in having the girl realizing she has feelings for him its trying to eat its cake and have it too.Then she has her realization about all this with Marks friend not Mark which is a poor script decision though consistent with the narrative abandoning Mark entirely which is consistent anyway with this feminist subversion perversion of Groundhog Day.His function ends up being to comfort her. She actually says Youre here so I wouldnt have to be alone and he nods along like a good doggy. ""Okay"" he says.I turned off this travesty with a few minutes left. No its not even worth sticking around for the ending.",1.0,2487

Peaceful224, You're probably misunderstanding,Ive read some reviews and I think that some are missing the point of it. Yes I think its true that hollywood is annoyingly using the same tropes over and over again. I think that the makers of this movie wanted to give a specific message and tell their story through this unoriginal concept. Some of the negative reviewers are saying that this film has nothing new to offer but I disagree. I think that it brings up some good questions about life. I really think that this movie is more than just a run of the mill teen romance. It seems like most teen flicks feel the need to be edgy and trashy. While many enjoy that it isnt everyones cup of tea.I enjoyed how colorful it is and I thought that the acting was really good. I think that it manages to be quirky without diving into annoying territory. I think that it blended the drama and humor together well. I liked the soundtrack. That one shot scene was done so well!Perhaps this movie is more deep than its meant to be. I agree with the comments about how its another teen movie getting all existential but I still like the way that it was handled. I love good symbolism in any story. The dog represents all the time that can pass by. We see so much but are missing exactly what were looking for even when its right there in front of us. The angel wings. I believe that they represent how theres always good in this world of evil. The eagle catching the fish from the lake. Well the female character explains that one. Spoiler- rain in stories usually symbolizes the new in life. Washing away the old. It could mean that theres something better. I suppose that there could be even more that I missed.Unfortunately once again they cast actors that are too old to be playing teens. I also was not a fan of the sob story plot twist near the end.I was also SO disappointed that they ended up kissing at the end. I love stories that are simply just about friendship and I got my hopes up with this one. I almost believed that they wouldnt end up together at the end. It seemed refreshing.I can understand why this movie did not work for some but I liked it. I watched it on valentines day. Its also a good movie for february because of groundhog day!,8.0,2493

brettfarrell, Its... ok,If you smile kick back and dont think too hard this movie is pretty enjoyableIf you DO want to think at all during this movie youll likely realize that its predictable (not necessarily a bad thing) and too caught up in itself much like a teenagerThe main character doesnt do anything really wild with his infinite do-overs and skips through his morning routine of glibly helping and also trolling people around him since he knows whats going to happen to them and when he meets the Smart Girl who is also in the loop with him (who wants to work for NASA and does smart people things like math and solving a Rubiks cube) they try to find all of the events that they inconsistently define as perfect in their small townThere are a couple little twists and a bit of drama but overall it definitley wants to be deeper than it is,4.0,2497
stklaus, Most unscrupulous try to cash in with a movie in history.,You know what an a*** is (cant write it out its an insult)? An a*** is someone who takes advantage of his environment or other people for his own purpose. A real a*** screenwriter would take the idea of the best comedy ever and just copy it for the lack of creativity own ideas visions or any other capabilities (a***es lack these). And then change a tiny detail and say: Look its a different movie!Thats exactly what happened here; dont believe anyone who tells you that is not Groundhog Day coz it is just that but the Michel-Bay-version of it. The only thing changed is the solution of coming out of the circle which makes no sense has no meaning is pseudo-math-BS and makes this copy even worse.Everything in this movie is phony false has been made better somewhere else; it has no charm no soul even the protagonists have this teflon-plastic aura.Who may like this movie: tasteless pricks school bullies or kids who have no clue that Groundhog Day even exists. Watching this tripe they will be traumatized and may never watch the Original or excellent versions of the material like Edge of Tomorrow or Palm Springs (these managed to make sth new of it).Dont believe the good reviews this is either family or guys with agenda.Finally I must admit it may have some entertainment value for teenagers but even that is mediocre fun.,1.0,2498

Lähdin katsomaan tätä ilman että juurikaan tiesin tästä mitään ja ehkä se on monissa tapauksissa paras. Ei liikaa ennakko odotuksia.Kathryn Newton jotenkin niin ihana tapaus toki nähnyt hänet tähän mennessä vain hieman omaan silmään epämukavissa rooleissa.Tämä onneksi yllätti. Vaikka aihe on jo käytetty tarina sen takana kuitenkin onnistui yllättämään positiivisesti. En oikeastaan keksi mitään huonoa tästä vaikkei se täydellinen ole mutta varsin onnistunut.

lorenzoamer, One of the Worst Movies I've Seen In My Life,Theres no creativity to the wardrobe everyone just wears whatever without metaphorical value. They throw around words like temporal anomaly and singularity without any further explanation to this infallible idea and believe we should understand it. The movie ends by wrapping up the most insignificant subplot. Almost every conversation our characters have are what they should do with infinite time and during these conversations they never stay still: they do something out of the ordinary and act like its perfectly normal. Literally every side-character is generic and useless as they serve the same metaphor. I was vastly uninterested in these characters to the point where when the movie Psychod itself and replaced the main character I was tempted to stop watching. The actual titular map only shows up twice. There are about six montages in this film and they are all useless.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is the reason Im happy film is highly flammable.

laplante-co-672-297856, Missed opportunity,Similar to the livelier and funnier Palm Springs this forgettable time waster is about two people sharing the same day over and over again. The central actors are charming enough but cant compare to the pair in Palm Springs. Nor does the movie do anything original with the concept.Which is a shame because in the last third of the movie two ideas are tossed out casually that actually do bring something original to the table. However THIS movie is only concerned with re-visiting the tropes of the genre so those ideas arent explored at all.No spoilers here but the central idea is: Instead of trying to break out of the loop what if there was a compelling reason to stay within the time loop... so compelling that you would do anything to prevent it?Imagine what you could do with that idea instead.

Safetylight," Feminists re-make Groundhog Day, for teens. It goes about as well as it could have.","Ive watched this once all the way through and then again to the half-way point a week or so later after puzzling over it. -Partly because I liked the male lead and some of the story mechanics but also because the weak and broken points of this movie were fascinating; ""How would I fix this?""Broken things are interesting.So.. I liked the male lead; he seemed genuine and kind. The actor made it seem effortless.The girl by contrast was stuck having to portray an anti-social and quite unlikable character. The production team worked the actress hard only to achieve a thoroughly forced caricature of the strong independent woman constantly sneering at the male half of the human equation. If thats the day you find yourself stuck in... Heaven help you.Now with more self-awareness this element could have provided fodder for a very interesting film indeed but most of the psychology responsible was happening beyond the cognition of the creators down on some automatic level. True there was an inkling of character growth (partly the reason I didnt write this movie off entirely and came back for a second look) where the female lead recognized that ""I met a nice boy but I messed it all up"" drawing a useful conclusion between behavior and outcome but that lesson was smothered beneath external ideological demands the writer wasnt free of. So instead the film was primarily an exercise in artificially elevating the feminine at the expense of the masculine.Im guessing that the film makers dont know that truly strong women out here in the real world are completely different.Genuinely strong women dont have to be snide secretive emotionally shallow fakes in order to hold power. Thats what weak bitter people do in an effort to compensate. People actually LIKE being around genuinely strong women are indeed guided and changed by them in ways this film hasnt managed to divine. Folks really need to get out there and encounter the feminine principle in person sometime and for goodness sake avoid feeling threatened to the point of attacking it when they do.So.. my advice to the creative team responsible allow me to mansplain: In the future (heh) dont let some post-modern ideology poison what could have been a strong and inspiring film. This was like a chocolate bar which had been made with sour milk.Too bad.",6.0,2518

Argyle302, Perfecting Timelessness,"Contemporary Groundhog Day story which is done pretty well. Solid characters and performances throughout along with the storyline that should keep your interest peaked. The only flaw in the movie is that they had to include a couple liberal ideals; global warming and climate change  which are both just power grab hoaxes by globalist elites. One of the lead characters even shows a bit of hypocrisy on this subject mentioning her concern for climate change but almost in the same sentence wonders what the world will be like when shes 80 years old. Arent these climate change zealots constantly reminding us all that the World will end in another 10 years???All in all a fun movie that would make Phil Connors proud.

I assume a profound ""meaning of life"" message was supposed to be hidden in there too.

Dragava, A Wonderful Surprise,"Its not often Im surprised by how I feel about a film. Usually prior to going in I know exactly what Ill think of it once its over. But in this case I was wrong.I was expecting yet another teenage treacle plot with the central characters pontificating on the ""beauty of the world"" with terms far beyond their years. But what I instead got was an extremely sweet relevant tale about time and growing up that is both important for young viewers and nostalgic for old.The performances are pitch perfect. Whoever cast these two leads is very good at their job. The main actor I had never seen in anything before but he plays this reminiscent of Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You and that is something to be extremely proud of. He looks and acts much like the posthumous legend and Im excited to see what hell do in the future. Kathryn Newton is once again excellent continuing her Big Little Lies stride and emanating a very sweet vulnerability that would make any teenage boy blush.Its very refreshing to watch a film where the director allows the actors to simply act. There are moments that just hold on the faces of the leads to let the audience seep into their emotional states and builds your relationship with them. Its funny bright and hopeful by the end of the film with a nice message from this formula that at this point could well be rote but the talent behind the script and cast proves otherwise.",7.0,2524
leftbanker-1," Nothing Special, But What is These Days?",Movies and TV are mostly just plain horrible so a perfectly OK film is like a masterpiece in comparison. This is a messed-up way to look at the world but welcome to lock-down where I have more time on my hands than these two teens.This began with promise so much that I stopped and tracked down the short story its based on. The story wasnt much and seemed so self-conscious about stealing the idea from the movie Groundhog Day that it never really took on a life of its own-this is also the problem with the film.It tries to be sweet and for that I rank it higher than I normally would but it just doesnt have a lot going for it.Im not really sure about the lead actress and why she wasnt right in this. Usually I blame bad acting on the director but Im not sure it was bad acting or just her terrible hair. Either way it she didnt fit not for me. The kid wasnt much better. There were no decent secondary roles. They tried to pump up his little sister at the end but it was too little too late.Whatever this was far better that the 50 super-violent movies dumped on the public last week.,6.0,2525

ethanbresnett, Brilliant!,The whole time loop genre is right up my street. From Edge of Tomorrow to Palm Springs if it has a time loop Ill watch it no questions asked. That being said I wasnt necessarily expecting much from The Map of Tiny Perfect Things as it has middling reviews and seemed to be flying under the radar in terms of internet chatter but boy was I surprised.This movie is such a joy to watch. It just does pretty much everything right from the characters the style the direction the script the plot the soundtrack. Just beautiful.Kathryn Newton was incredible as Margaret and had great chemistry with Kyle Allen. Both of their characters were well thought out and were played to perfection. Their interactions always felt real and both of them felt lived in and relatable.In terms of the plot it really was quite special. It had some great messages in there from taking a moment to stop and appreciate life to learning to move on and live life. It explored all of its themes in quite profound ways at times through effective comedy and tender emotional moments.Theres lots to digest with this film as we jump between different genres. We sort of get teen romance a bit of sci-fi comedy coming of age drama and tragedy all in the space of an hour and a half.On top of all of this the film just has such a great vibe. Its a hard one to explain but when you finish this film you will just sort of feel content and warm.Fantastic.,8.0,2527

accounstv, Very nice,"As a sexagenarian I am not the target audience for this film but I like anything that is good. I was thumbing through my Roku looking for a movie to play while I gamed and read a book. The reason I stopped to play this film was because I had seen Kathryn Newton the previous day in ""Freaky."" She is very good here as she was in that film.Another reviewer said that they were ""drawn into the film"" and so was I. My gaming stopped as did the book reading and my attention became focused on MTPT. I found it charming and Ms. Newton was very good as was Jermaine Harris but felt that Mr. Allen failed to deliver on some one word lines that would have improved the quality of his performance and the film. The director should have caught these and worked with him on the line deliveries and the fact that he did not may represent a shortfall in Ian Samuels ability at least this point in his career.Overall a very nice and charming little film which is the type I love to find. A lot of reviewers are rating this a nine but Im a hard marker and will give it a seven which is pretty good since I gave Hitchcocks ""Foreign Correspondent"" a six.Well worth your time and attention.",7.0,2535

ivanmessimilos, Standard Liam Neeson movie,This is only the second film by director Robert Lorenzo. Whos he? Exactly. He is best known as an assistant director and producer of mostly Clint Eastwood films and some great ones like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. His first solo film is Trouble with the Curve where the main role is played surprisingly by Clint Eastwood himself. I really liked that movie. The difference between this and this film is the script this time he wrote it himself and it is not good at all. It is often predictable one-way and uneven. Overall though I cant judge the film with Liam Neeson where he plays himself badly. He will turn 69 this year and he is still making films like this. I call this a typical Liam Neeson movie if youve watched one in the last ten years youve watched it all. A gloomy man with a difficult and vulnerable past who does not look for troubles but they find him and he possesses special skills that he is forced to use. The good thing about movies like this is that you know youre going to get what you expected and all of those movies are good or very good they wont disappoint you. Same thing with this movie. If youre going to look for holes in the script or criticize the characters then this is not the movie for you. If youre looking for a movie that will entertain you or take a break from your commitments for a hundred minutes and youre a fan of Mr. Neeson like me then I can definitely recommend this movie to you.,6.0,2539

joshuarenealvarez, The Marksman (2021),The Marksman is an action-thriller co-writtenand directed by Robert Lorenz. He is best knownfor his collaborations with Clint Eastwood as assistant director and producer in iconic films such as Million Dollar Baby Mystic River and American Sniper. This is his second feature-length film to date. The plot follows a former marine-turned-rancher named Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson) who stumbles upon Rosa and Miguel a mother and a son who are being hunted by cartel assassins along the Arizona-Mexican border. Thus he brings it on himselfto stage an intervention. The narrative is reminiscentto Road to Perdition and Logan where the titularcharacter forms an eventual bond with a youth in danger.But I would recommend that you watch those filmsinstead as you will receive far more satisfaction as opposed to The Marksman which is a pretty forgettable filmin my opinion. The storyline is straightforward predictable and as clichéd as it sounds. It contained recycled material that weve witnessed over the years and its the reason whyI would not advise anyone to consume their precious time with this film. Only if you are an avid follower of Liam Neesons filmography and you personally enjoy seeing him in these action-fueled roles which is still astonishing to me given his age. The actor clearly has more fight in him before he decides to hang up the boxing gloves.He was only the benefactor for this experience as thefilm lacks many redeeming qualities. Especially with the selling point for this film which is the relationship between Jim Hansen and Miguel. I didnt fully accept it as their characters werent fleshed out enough and that same issue contributed to my dissatisfaction with the supporting cast members as well as their uninspiring performances.This isnt the worst of film of the new year.But it isnt an exceptional one by any means.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez@theflowerhuman.,6.0,2551

mellonmationsyt, Severely dissapointing,"I should preface this review by saying I saw this movie in theaters with my mom who said it would be a good movie and people were saying it was good. The way it was described was misleading the trailer made some very questionable choices so walking into the theatre I went in completely impartial I wasnt expecting good I wasnt expecting bad. The film is extremely mediocre and safe you dont learn anything or come away with a different point of view which is what the film intended. The frame rate was extremely high and while that sounds like a good thing it was genuinely nauseating. It felt like a rollercoaster with how everything moved and happened. While the cinematography was great the story wasnt. The Villans make unreasonable choices that drive the plot. While at the end theres a decent character arc for the main villain the hero doesnt. Most characters dont really change and the morale and character traits feel very forced. The film seems somewhat political and while thats not necessarily a bad thing or a film killer it wants to change the opinion of boarder control activists. It boarder line shoves the message down your throat. If your a film buff you may have noticed the plot isnt original its leon: the professional. The plot is very similar except for the ""on the run"" aspect of the film while I dont think its bad for it to take a little inspiration it doesnt feel original at all. Genuinely its not as good as Ive heard people call it its an overbudgeted safe unoriginal movie. The characters lack personality and plot feels unnecessary. Good background noise.",5.0,2553

Gentzen," Boy, Liam Neeson must really need the cash...","Suggested this for viewing to my partner who likes Liam Neason. By midpoint I had to apologize to her. One of the reviewers here wrote ""this is by no means an exceptional movie"". This should get the Understatement of the Year award. Cliched script plodding direction bad acting: Katheryn Winnick in a pointless bit part was the only female presence of any note and most of her acting was done by her low-cut tops (which every self-respecting State police woman wears as standard issue). Mr. Neesons character looked genuinely tired and frustrated with his life but this did not require any acting on his part the script took care of it. Everybody else looked like they were doing a chore. Dialogue was awful and seemed like teased with pliers. Action was sparse and not entertaining and the chemistry between the lone old man and the boy non-existent. And then there were the plot holes... Oh my where does one begin: seasoned cartel enforcers walk casually uncovered on open fields knowing that may be targeted through a rifle scope. A man shot and stabbed several times can of course typically drive for several miles afterwards. Nobody even bats an eyelid when a person covered in blood marks gets on a public bus staggering. One can go on.Shame for Liam really who has given us some very decent and entertaining movies even late in his career. This is not one of them by any means so youd do well to look elsewhere for quality or even simple night-at-home entertainment. Mr. Neeson may be out for some extra cash but it neednt be yours.",3.0,2555

cmhouser, Nonsensical story that goes nowhere...,"Greetings film goers! Are you looking for a movie that tells a story which has no basis in reality and only exists as a piggyback to Liam Niesons career? Hope so!Im a huge Liam Nieson fan. Unfortunately he seemingly will forever be in ""Taken"" remakes of various varieties. Even worse BAD Taken remakes with terrible plots. Well if youve found this review youve also found The Marksman (or Taken 10).Another unfortunate outcome of this movie is the predictable acting. Liam Nieson plays the role which they hired him and in true fashion he does it very well. But weve seen this role about a million times now. I like Katheryn Winnick as an actress and would like to see her in more films. However like Nieson her acting chops cant fill the gap of a boring pointless character who has no real purpose. Waste of talent IMO. And I think thats the underlying story here = BORING characters and predictable Hollywood plots.This story feels recycled and weve seen this one over and over again. Even worse it has no basis in reality. The story is nonsensical and feels like Hollywoods take on what they THINK happens at the border. Well if you can imagine how uninformed they are regarding average ordinary life... you can imagine their take on the border situation.In summary if this film had any other starring actor other than Liam Nieson it would have been on Lifetime or some obscure cable channel. Waste of good acting talent. Waste of good West Texas scenery. Waste of your time. If you like Nieson go see Cold Pursuit. Its a MUCH better movie where Liam Nieson essentially plays the EXACT SAME character but is much better written/directed.",3.0,2562

This is a character driven movie as much as an action film. I kept wanting to get popcorn but was riveted the whole time and didnt want to miss a thing. I was also quite moved by Liams characters back story and how it impacted his decision to help the young boy to safety. Their scenes together were quite touching. The ending also surprised me as it gave a few seconds of humanity to someone whom I would never suspect deserved it. Unfortunately we can all become victims of situations that are beyond our control.

darangulafilm, THE MARKSMAN. WORTH A LOOK.,"Other reviewers have given the makers of this screen story a bit of an undeserved caning.Is it genre-fare written to an apparent familiar formula? Yes. There is a practical limit to how many stories can be really original any more.The story backbone has been told in many forms before and being a writer I had a fair clue how it was going to conclude. The characters were drawn well by their respective actors.Was the story well executed? Yes I think it was. It was also raised beyond slam bamm and drink the bourbon. Any more detail and I will be publishing spoilers.Contrary to the genre the young character wass written without smart backanswers emotional hystrionics and generally unlikeable behaviour towards adults.The writers wisely avoided the cliche of victim aggression and acting out towards the rescuer in some sort of emotional and revelationary rehook into a new story chapter. That has been overdone so much over the years as to be maukish.The young actor gives a surprisingly restrained performance maybe influenced by Liam Neeson or carefully directed or both.There were opportunities in the story for a director to be tempted into a few clammy cliches which were thankfully avoided.The locations were not recognisable from other movies so that was a refreshing change.With the music underscore I was quite impressed. Part of the head and tail bookends seem to be homage to two other films from the 80s and 90s in their arrangement and tone colours. However they were entirely original and skillfully woven.The underscore through the film does not draw attention and may have been even left absent for all I know. That is when underscores work best. No musical distractions were necessary anywhere to ""save"" the film. That speaks for the work done by the writer and director more so than folk may realise.If you have the opportunity to see the film in a cinema I recommend you do so.",8.0,2593

Desertman84, Our Late Career Action Hero Liam Neeson Is Back As Clint Eastwood In The Marksman,"Our late career action hero Liam Neeson is back in what Clint Eastwood have starred decades of his acting career as Jim Hanson in ""The Marksman"".Katheryn Winnick co-stars in this film directed by Robert Lorenz.In itwe get to see an Arizona border patrol member who protects a young Mexican boy who is desperately fleeing from the assassins of a cartel. As he gets to the border in Arizonawe get to see the cartel pursues the young boy as the latter gets to land in the US.The movie was definitely serviceable at best. No question that Liam Neeson delivers as Jim - the marksman - which is enough to make it entertaining. Also we get to see him morphing into the new Clint Eastwood.

zardoz-13, Misses the Mark,"The cliches fly like bullets in ""Trouble With the Curve"" director Robert Lorenzs formulaic cartel thriller ""The Marksman"" with rugged Liam Neeson as a troubled ex-Marine who swaps lead with murderous Mexican cartel killers on a road trip to Chicago. Tom Hanks took an orphan girl across Texas to her relatives in ""News of the World"" and Neeson takes a Mexican boy from Arizona to Illinois in this modern-day crime melodrama. When a mom and her son scramble across the border on foot with cartel gunmen at their heels a widowed American rancher Jim Hanson intervenes with his rifle and thwarts their pursuit with gunfire. Now ""The Marksman"" isnt a movie bristling with wall-to-wall violence. Several people die and some die off-screen. Nevertheless this predictable but complicated PG-rated pursuit yarn often stretches credibility to the breaking point. Lorenz and freshman writers Chris Charles and Danny Kravitz give us nothing we havent seen already in gritty suspenseful sagas like ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007) ""Savages"" (2012) ""End of Watch"" (2012)""The Last Stand"" (2013) Sicario"" (2015) its sequel ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" (2018) ""Miss Bala (2019) ""Peppermint"" (2018) and ""Rambo: Last Blood"" (2019). Instead Lorenz and company recycle moldy cliches and stale stereotypes with few surprises. Occasionally our seasoned hero has some ""Rambo"" moments but few and far between are these. Our protagonist often behaves like he has never seen a television crime show. This 107-minute movie may unravel your patience. Not only has our hero forgotten everything he learned in two tours of Vietnam but he also doesnt realize they are tracking him via his credit card purchases. Indeed the Liam Neeson character makes several appalling mistakes during his flight that will infuriate audiences who craved his ""Taken"" movies.Jim (Liam Neeson of ""Cold Pursuit"") has fallen on hard times with no relief in sight. After cancer claimed his wife an avalanche of medical bills descended on him and he cannot pay them. Now his friendly banker warns him he is 90 days away from eviction from hearth and home. Basically Jim is a lost soul when he nearly runs down a young migrant woman Rosa (Teresa Ruiz of ""Bordertown"") and her 11-year-old son Miguel (newcomer Jacob Perez) who have abandoned everything in their flight to Arizona. Rosas ill-fated brother Carlos (Alfredo Quiroz of ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"") who served as a courier for the cartel let his greed doom him. Moments before the cartel catches up with him Carlos warns Rosa to vamos before they come for their pound of flesh. The cartel makes examples of their own when they betray them. Jim didnt have enough to worry about before he nearly collided with Rosa and Miguel in the road he does now. Basically the border wall fence lines Jims ranch in southern Arizona and the rancher is dutifully making his rounds when he catches these innocents trespassing. During a brief firefight Jim drives off the killers but not before poor Rosa takes a slug and dies at the scene. Mind you things are about to get far worse. Now Jim wrestles with his conscience because he feels responsible for Rosas death. The cartel retreat to lick their wounds and Jim calls the Border Patrol. Before she died Rosa had pleaded desperately with Jim to help them. Now as guilt sets in Jim realizes he must help Rosas son. If Miguel is deported back to Mexico the cartel will turn him into one of their own.Up until this point ""The Marksman"" has shown promise. We want our tough guy hero with a heart of gold to save Miguel and slaughter these cartel crazies. However everything falters when Jim asks to see Miguel at the Border Patrol Station. Just before he walks into the facility Jim spots Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba of ""Peppermint"") and his minions waiting outside the station. Now all the Border Patrol Agents are chummy with Jim because his stepdaughter Sarah (Katheryn Winnick of ""Failure to Launch"") works there as a Border Patrol Agent too. Inside the station a Border Patrolman against his better impulses gives Jim a moment with Miguel because he must catch an urgent call. Our hero displays his sense of audacity when he ushers little Miguel out of the holding room as well as the Border Patrol Station in plain sight of everybody. Nobody spots him on the surveillance monitors and he cruises off with Miguel sitting beside him in his battered pick-up truck. Mind you during the abortive firefight at the border the cartel riddled Jims truck with a hail of gunfire. Incredibly Jim hasnt bothered to repair the damage so he has been driving around with a punctured radiator but he hasnt noticed it leaking! Jim plans to take Miguel to his relatives in Chicago but Miguel isnt talking to him.Miguel holds Jim responsible for his mothers death. Nevertheless these two will forge a friendship that defies ethnicity and age. Jim makes his second mistake when he trusts his truck to hold together with a patch job after Mauricio and company had peppered it with bullet holes. Incidentally Jim doesnt have a cell phone because he has no one to call. One of the grimmest scenes occurs when Mauricio pumps a vulnerable female gas station clerk full of bullets when she refuses to help him. Like Mauricios hoodlums we are outside the convenience store when the gun shots ring out with ominous clarity. If the villains were despicable when they strung up Carlos from an overpass the murder of the helpless girl makes them cold-blooded dastards. Eventually our noble hero catches a slug in the gut and Mauricio dices him up with a knife to ribs. A sentimental saga with a dreary ending ""The Marksman"" never scores enough bullseyes to keep us engrossed in his plight. If you abhor movies where you can guess the outcome long before the heroes and the villains youre going to be grumbling throughout ""The Marksman.""",5.0,2615

Liam seas it but doesnt repots it! I think cops would be on bad guys tail like moth to a flame ! For the story to be believable cop must survive or gets shot by Liams gun . Then bad guy kills dog while police is close by ! I mean nobody in this movie hears the gunshots .. at list put a silencer .. make it believable!All in all not a bad movie but lacks credibility and consistency and dont get me started on originality.,5.0,2621
kekermawi-78568, Liam is usually awesome but this!!,Cant believe how incredibly stupid this movie is. Its slow and illogical on so many levels.

I watched out of boredom but this movie made me even more bored. You could see how the movie and its ending unfolding a mile away.,1.0,2622

wittstockwilliam, A Drama/Western Guaranteed to Move Any Viewer,An incredibly beautiful drama/western redemption story complemented by beautiful cinematography. The movie doesnt just show or tell; it PULLS the audience into the lives of Jim and Miguel fully investing them into their journey. It was so wonderfully moving to watch their characters grow. When the credits rolled I sat there wishing I could just see what happened next in their lives. Liam Neesons acting prowess only adds to the experience - witnessing him swing between ex-marine badass to loving caretaker is a complete delight. The story is topical and feels real which only helps immerse the viewer mentally and emotionally. Previously I had never seen a movie where the audience applauded at the climax of the story. But now I can say that I have.,10.0,2625

stellarockc-57448, Please STOP Liam...,This movie is so predictable and to be quite honest...horrible. The director must have taken this project out of boredom because it shows in every frame the movie could have been made in thirty minutes if the dull boring scenes had been removed and the predictable and unrealistic scenes had been combined to the conclusion that we knew was coming. Regrettably we opted to see this as our second choice because our preferred showing was near full and we opted to be safe and not take on the crowded theater ...we made a bad decision! Liam you deserve better and please dont do it just for the money anymore.,2.0,2627
Josiah23," As with most action movies made today, it carries the scent of loftier ambitions",I think there are several compelling factors about this movie that need to be pointed out if they havent already been done so. Number one some fresh takes on some old themes. What I liked most among these was the soldier mentality and code of honor exhibited by both the main villain and the hero the fact that they both have something in common... or at least it is perceived that way. The fact that the villain keeps one of Hensons military medals offering it up to him in the end relinquishing his envy for the man and in return gaining a little bit of respect... enough to have earned a soldiers choice (how you die).The young boy with the deep soul. The first thing we learn about him is that his ambitions in love give him a kind of divine confidence and the ability to see beauty anywhere (even from a sunlit gummy bear). He understands his mothers death and is able to process it in such a way that guides Liam NÃ©e sons character. After the death of the dog the trip to the church to pay respects to Miguels mother was a much needed reprieve in the storyline and one you dont often find in this type of action-thriller.I thought this movie was well blended with action and drama. Enough action to create suspense enough drama to keep your attention. Overall I would give it ten stars because I would like to see more movies like this.,10.0,2628

chris-h-3, Uninspired throwback thriller,This film feels very much like an 80s direct to video film. It lacks any originality the writing throughout both dialogue and plot is poor and unbelievable and the direction pedestrian at best.Perhaps with a more charismatic lead it wouldve been more involving but when you dont care for the characters and the film is something youve seen dozens of times before then there is not much to recommend it.,3.0,2641
latinfineart, Severely mediocre,Hollywood has really really lost the plot. They are having a harder and harder time coming up with anything original anything stimulating anything interesting or anything thats well done and in particular the writing just seems to be going further and further down hill.You really have to look to the independents or the foreign films for anything of substance. Hollywood is culturally bankrupt and this movie is proof of that theory. Neesan is making some pretty poor choices and he seemed like anything other than a marksman in this film.

tobydammit-2, Best movie I've seen since the pandemic began!,I was disappointed with the ending (which Ive felt about every film made since 1974 when Hollywood writers all forgot how to write endings) and I wont spoil it for anyone by revealing it but apart from that it was exactly what it was supposed to be...an entertaining action movie with suspense and thrills that builds characters you care about and are left feeling like good has triumphed over evil.

dlmiley, In defense of Liam...,This movie is by no means Liam Neesons best film. But it is not terrible. His performance is good as another tortured soul haunted by the loss of his wife and potential loss of his farm. True the story is formulaic but the movie is eminently watchable and the digital cinematography is excellent (especially evident towards the end of the film). I reserve ratings 4 and below for movies that are technically incompetent or completely incoherent which this movie is certainly is NOT. I rated it as a 6 (probably closer to 5.5 but there are no decimals allowed on IMDB). I would recommend this movie for those looking for decent entertainment nothing more nothing less.,6.0,2648

destroyerwod, Liam Neeson to sell/carry a generic VOD-style movie...,"Lets be honest this is a VERY average movie. The story aint bad yet very clichÃ© the acting is decent the chemistry between Liam and the kid co-star is alright altough not great either but the movie itself is a slow drag. Liam Neeson captured lightning in a bottle with Taken many years ago. Not to say he was not a great actor before but peoples started to see him as a legit action movie star after that movie yet he keep appearing in what are mostly slow dragged ""thrillers/drama"" these days sold like action movies ?Yes Liam is not really young anymore i am not expecting full on fist fight goodness like a Scott Adkins flick but they could certainly have him shoot more guns have more stunts and car pursuits exiting stuff that could be done easily with stunt doubles or respecting his age.This movie is VERY slow pace there is a few action scenes but they are far in between and altough the premise is mostly the 2 lead on the run of the cartel there is never much tension.Yet despite all of this it manage to just entertain you enough to not bore you. Mostly because Liam Neeson has a great presence he is a recognizable name and like i said the chemistry with the kid is believable. But its obvious this is another ""chainmade"" scripts like the movie industry pull out a gazillion times each year that they feed to a ""big name"" to sell purchases/rentals and make a decent ammount of $. The surprising part is that this movie actually released in theatre as well. No idea if its because there aint much movies right now due to Covid but it has everything to be a low budget direct to VOD movie the likes you see countless times from Nick Cage or Steven Seagal.Overall nothing much else to say it filled one of my movie nights while being ""ok"" but i will certainly never watch it again.Oh and Katheryn Winnick fans... well she is barely in the movie at all and dont do much so dont get your hopes too high.",5.0,2651
meneermalik-1, To call this an action/thriller is a big stretch!,"Dreadful action movie sorry Liam. At almost 2 hours long this really would have greatly benefited from a heavy cut in the editing room and brought down to a lean 75-80 minutes. The biggest issues with this movie is 1) lack of action apart from a few small sections in the movie. And 2) extremely drawn out. The bulk of the movie is Liam with a kid where the dialogue is equal to a highschool play.I got into bed at night thinking Id have something decent to watch and instead just found myself fast forwarding these scenes just so I can get this movie over with. Theres lots more that makes this movie sink in quicksand but thats the main of it.

Thats why it never becomes really suspenseful or thrilling. Never.

nikola17, it's nothing that special it's okay film for time waster,I love Liam Nesson he works in action films great I enjoyed Taken 1-3 Unknown The Grey A Walk Among the Tombstones Non-Stop Run All Night The Commuter Cold Pursuit Honest Thief now with this film its less action in trailer it shows more action then to actual film not kidding at all its more in trailer and Less in actual film with less action film and more of a bland road-trip style drama style on run. and yeah story is same topical thing Jim (Liam Nesson) A previous member of the Marine Corp Jim struggles with alcohol and is unapologetically atheist which I found interesting for a character in amainstream film a Marksman expert. he was just driving aheading home and suddenly he found a boy Miguel and his mother Rosa were on run after her brother told her to get out of dodge one of cartels are after them because they know where the money is hidden Rosa dies she tells Jim to take her son to Chicago to be safe Jim expected her offer he does it he accept it now he is on run to take Miguel and product him and take him to Chicago. they are on run to get away from cartels that wants Miguel. thats topical film as olden days now if you watch trailer and think oh its action film full on 1 hour and 48 minutes well its not it has less action more of drama sadly I wished this film to be better I wanted what I wanted movie to be more action but trailer has more action then to actual film thats what begged me for threw out film. I enjoyed Liam Nesson and kid Miguel Their scenes together were quite touching and they got to know each other the chemistry between those 2 were good. The script is good not greatest script but script is fine nothing is bad what Inotice. its worth checking out if you love Liam Nesson in action or drama films this is worth it but when you watch it dont follow my opinion make up your own mind if you like film I liked it but at end of day its time waster film not something I would want to watch everytime this film could been a Netflix film not an cinema release thats what I really wish for because its not full on fun action its drama-thriller bland film its not bad film to watch I thought it was enjoyable for Liam Nesson and for film when you see trailer dont expect for full on action like Taken and such its more of thriller-drama their is action couple of scenes but not much until at 3rd act of film at final moment their is action scene thats it dont expect this to be action film.,5.0,2670

Hammer-Rocks, No wonder people are crying for a wall,Im not from the US so I am not familiar with the border security challenges faced on the US/Mexico border.And while this movie isnt about border security if it represents even a small percentage of truth on what was shown on how seemingly easy it was for people to cross the border between the US & Mexico. Im now beginning to understand why so many people in the US are demanding for a wall to be built.As for the movie itself its another Neeson style movie where hes on a mission. The difference...this time hes the one being hunted rather than doing the hunting. The movie showed enough pace to keep me somewhat interested. But it also frustrated me on how (sometimes) clueless and bad luck Neesons character was having which kept providing enough clues for the bad guys to continually track where hes heading.I guess if it werent for these blunders the movie would be less dramatic.SUMMARY:Its a Neeson movie. A man on a mission for a worthy cause.VERDICT:Its worth a watch on a boring rainy day.,5.0,2677

kuner-59029," Slow, uninspired and banal",How did Liam Neeson go from Schindlers List to this?Sure you do some bad movies for a paycheck but usually he at least acts like he cares in his movies. In this film he just went on autopilot after the opening scene and the other actors look like theyre completely asleep. Out of all the auxiliary characters the kids mother the girl at the gas station and the main villains driver emote the most. Those are barely even speaking roles.Its hard to even call this a movie since there is barely any plot to the whole thing. Most of the setups go nowhere. Neesons relationship to his cop friend ends up being pointless filler his house is burned down after he already chose to leave he loses his rifle at one scene only to immediately buy another in a scene later. Hardly anything in the film is of consequence. Its basically Neeson and the kid who share absolutely no chemistry on a bland road trip and the bad guys slowly gaining on them because they track his credit card usage.There is no ticking clock element no hard choices to make by any of the characters nothing of consequence. Add to this the fact that the film has barely any score and only two action scenes one of which consists of guys walking slowly before being shot through a scope - off screen.The film feels like its trying to make a point about the border but I cant even make out what it is. Farmers shouldnt report illegals because the cartels may be after them? But at the same time the official border checkpoints are corrupt and the cartels just pass through? Buying an unregistered gun is good? All of these scenes felt tacked on and again have no bearing on the main plot.Rarely have I seen a script with so little thought put into it. This is a Nicholas Cage / Bruce Willis level bad film. I really hope Liam Neesons next project will be better than this. This is the latest and by far the worst in a string of stinkers.,2.0,2680

The-Sarkologist, Slow and Dragiing,At first I didnt really think too much of this film namely because it was certainly not what you would expect from Liam Neeson. Normally such a film would have him single handedly take down an entire Mexican drug cartel because well hes Liam Neeson and he does things like that. However this isnt that type of film. In fact I found that it was rather slow and dull. That is until you sit down and think about what they are trying to get across.So Neeson happens to be a rancher and an ex-Marine and he spends his days dealing with Coyotes and reporting illegal aliens that have made their way through the wall (or should I say fence). Anyway one day he encounters a woman and her child and as he prepares to take them to the border patrol some cartel members rock up and a shootout begins. Neeson then realises that he simply cannot send the boy back so decides to take him to Chicago.I guess there are two takeaway things from this film the main one being that many of us really dont understand why it is that people are attempting to enter the United States. There are cases that it is a life and death event though the suggestion is that while the kid might not be killed he would certainly not be going back to the world that he once knew - instead he would no doubt end up being another foot soldier for the Mexican cartels.Another thing is the suggestion that the cartels have a lot more influence than is made out. Just because they are based in Mexico does not mean that they have influences and bases in the United States. Nor does it mean that the guards along the border are all that pure either and act to prevent them from entering the US. In fact the suggestion is that the reach of the Cartels and the ability of many of the soldiers to get into the US is much easier than is realised (and this has been explored in other films as well).Another interesting thing is that Neesons wife died of cancer and while it isnt a big thing it is another subtle thing that exists in the background. It follows the idea of dont get sick in America meaning that a sick family member can easily bankrupt quite a lot of people. This is the situation that Neeson has found himself in particularly since his farm is on the verge of being repossessed.Okay it does have something thought provoking aspects to it but still I did find that the film was a little slow and a part of me would have preferred the old style Neeson action flick where he basically single handedly takes out an entire cartel.,5.0,2693

thealeciathomas, WARNING DOG MURDER IN THIS,"This was actually a pretty heart felt story and Liam was great as usual and the child actor surprisingly good. WHY did the dog need to die to make his character really ""spring into action"" There was a wonderful Border Collie actor in this that added a lot to the story and even helped on the journey. I really dont feel he had to die in it and Im still upset about it. Ever since John Wick it seems Hollywood needs to use dog murder as the heros motivation and I would have skipped this had I known.",5.0,2695

arklein328, Gripping and Emotional,"The Marksman is a gripping movie and not only in the ways the genre expects of it. Sure it is suspenseful and exciting but it also grabs the audience in emotional ways that are completely unexpected and that take this thriller to the next level. Too often ""action"" movies are so concerned with the suspense and thrill of it that they forget to put the same energy-if not more-into the story and the characters. But The Marksman knows that emotion is the key to genuine suspense. If we have an emotional connection to these characters we will care what happens to them. The movie uses that to its advantage and really successfully. The action truly means something here-the stakes feel real and they feel personal.But its not just the action or the life-or-death stakes that pack the punches. Its the quieter moments. The acting really sells these smaller scenes. Liam Neesons work is so subtle and yet he conveys so much emotion that its clear exactly what hes thinking and feeling in every scene-even if its just a small heartbreaking moment by himself (and there are many).Overall The Marksman provides a captivating experience for the audience in more ways than the average viewer might expect-be prepared to get emotional. (I might also suggest having a palate-cleansing comedy lined up for afterward.)",10.0,2697

Well not this one although he isnt really the star of this movie which qualifies as the most boring exorcism movie Ive ever seen. It plays like a really mediocre pilot to a bad TV series that will be canceled mid-season. Everything about it is off there is nothing scary or suspenseful the gore is bland its obvious that the film makers have no clue as to how to film horror. At times it was bad in a campy way that had me laughing a bad sign while watching a horror/thriller. To top it off Vadhir Derbez  the real lead has to be one of the most dreary actors ever. Either he was given poor direction on how to play his part or hes just naturally an awful actor. The plot is filled with holes a certain twist I guessed early on the writing is lazy scenes that could have worked with some build-up had none and worst of all I struggled to stay awake.

iamkrause, The filmakers rested all seven days,Full disclosure I dont like exorcism movies. But I want to like them. I keep watching them in hopes I find one Ill like. The Seventh Day is not it. Pitch shifters? Check. Boo faces? Check. Priests saying prayers? Check. Anything new or interesting? Thats a big nope. Guy Pearce sounds like the Mahk guy from Zebra Corner. His partner has the personality of a flaccid kielbasa. The possessed kid is even worse. Ive heard better sounding demon voices on my 80s heavy metal records. Certain events take place in front of multiple people and the main characters proceed to the next scene without anyone saying anything. They give away the twist 15 minutes before it happens. The twist is boring. The final showdown is uninspired weak-sauce. And then the movie ends with a set-up like its the first episode of some cheap new streaming series. Oh and the worse thing is that Keith David is in this movie and they completely waste his potential. The man is a legend and deserves better. So does the audience.There is no excuse for this movie. If people keep paying for this nonsense the studios will keep making it. If youve never seen an exorcism movie please dont start with this one. If you like them please dont waste your time with this one.Ill try to say something positive. There was one scene involving a hallway with a strobing effect that looked pretty cool. But 20 seconds of cool does not make up for the remaining 1 hour 26 minutes and 50 seconds of this steaming pile of generic excrement.,3.0,2773
jewelch, Not to good.,"I must say this movie is a little overhyped. But for many audience it might be a great movie . I expected a lot from this movie after going through the positive reviews. Very sorry to say but this movie didnt meet my expectation.

raybennetthays, Real bad,The acting is exceptional...ly bad the movie is boring and predictable its just a lame exorcist ripoff the script is cliche and I wanted Keith David and there was a total lack of Keith David they literally put him in the top billed cast... and killed him off in the first 10 minutes! Really bad movie.,2.0,2776
ttzimas, You should have picked The Seven Days in prison,Soooooo Guy Pearce was driving in a forgotten city and he probably did a minor DUI. The local serif who arrested him had an nephew that was trying to enter the movie business. The serif gave Guy Pearce the choice either spend seven days in prison or act in one movie!! He should have done the time like a man!!! (true story)The film is not that bad they tried to do something not sure what they had a twist they had simple jump scares they had 3 good actors (you know witch 3) but they didnt even do the basic scary movie Cliché.If you are 10000% sure that there is nothing on TV you can waste one and a half hour and watch this attempt of a movie. You cant make it from the first tries but keep doing what you like and you will be improved.,3.0,2777

kodiakblack, Guy Pearce deserved better.,At least it had a tiny twist but my spouse and I predicted it from the first scene so... Not very twisty after all. Was difficult to finish but we felt we had to after paying for it. Story had more holes than a golf course. Cringy acting from every single person except for Guy. People get hurt severely and barely react. Its insane. Also theres no consequences for anything. Even murder.,1.0,2779
jesybear, I can't believe Guy Pearce was in this.,Im a massive horror fan watch at least 5 new horror movies a week. I gave this 3 stars because the production was good but thats what makes it that much worse with how poor the story is. You would think with good actors and a decent budget they should have been able to make a good horror movie. Ive seen much better filmed on an iPhone with first time actors. Im really disappointed with this film.,3.0,2780
roverite1970-682-875506," Not for everyone, but I actually enjoyed this cheesy film",I went into this not expecting anything at all. Guy Pearce is always a good watch and he is as good in this as other films. The script isnt going to win an Oscar but the premise of the story is good.A young priest is sent to work with an exorcist (Pearce) who has some alternative ways of working. You get a bit of his backstory as to why he does what he does and he has to mentor the somewhat nervy Fr Daniel thrown into the world of aggressive exorcisms.There are a few good moments in the movie and without spoiling it the ending you could see coming about 2/3rds of the way through but it still entertained me.I think with a bit of polish on the script this could have been a lot better but I give it an 8 as I enjoyed it and in todays bland movie scene thanks to Covid this did take me away from everything for 90 minutes.,8.0,2781
koyen, Yeah !!! Definitely worth a watch...,If youve seen the rite with Anthony Hopkins (epic amazing slow burn) and appreciated that then trust me this will be your movie its so powerful with the absolute trust in God its a thriller not a horror movie ...but still I think I will keep a light on tonight LOL ...well filmed well acted and well done.,9.0,2782

somerville2003, utterly rubbish,They could have ramped this up more evil dead style but it started taking itself way too seriously and totally lacking in reality.1st example: two priests take 3 kids into the disused part of an arcade?- what planet was the writer/director/actors on ffs!?2nd example: kid starts displaying obvious supernatural abilities while being assessed for being a criminal murderer or to be sent to an asylum and everyones just standing about having a chatter like nothing happened.3rd example: possessed kid goes on a killing rampage throughout a police station they then just take the kid away somewhere?- no further police involvement needed obviously.4th example: aunt of a priest who works in the head priests place approaches young priest and gives him her nephews number(turns out hes a demon priest) shes very odd and looked like she could be one of the demons. At the end the priest after now knowing about the demon clergy doesnt even acknowledge she could be a demon or the head priest but does in the end aim to hunt down the demon nephew priest(as confirmed earlier to be a demon during a call he sent demon nephew priest).The whole film was an utter mess.,2.0,2785

clennan, Decent.,"Bad casting on the lead but decent story-line/script although I admit its a bit picked off from other exorcism movies. Needed more Guy Pearce too. The Director or perhaps editor was a bit off but overall it was suspenseful. I think it started really well and then got a bit forced and/or choppy after Daniel visits the house murder scene.Def should of been more Keith David like one person said and the lead should of gone to the kid who played young Peter along side Keith. He has great presence and will probably hear more from him in the future! (Chris Galust)One reviewer wanted the song that played in the credits. ""The Prodigal Sun"" by The Black Angels.

I have seen a lot of paranormal/exorcism movies and all I have to say is that THIS MOVIE is UNPREDICTABLE. I couldnt take my eyes off the screen. The ENDING was BY FAR the most CRAZIEST UNPREDICTABLE plot twist. I DID NOT find it ""dull"" or ""boring"" . This is honestly my FAVORITE MOVIE YET! 10/10 .

gpx_fto, Actually had a good plot + Good message,The #1 reason I come to imdb is because they show the viewer review ratings first not the critic rating which cuts down good movies that dont adhere to the critics checklist.This movie is a prime example of one such movie. It ACTUALLY has a good plot and leans on the plot much more than it does on cheap scares (of which there are a few).Anybody that appreciates the telling of a story in a movie which builds suspends and reveals details as the film progresses wont be disappointed. I found myself watching wanting to know how it ends and was hooked in until the end.My real rating for this movie is a 7.5/10 but I gave it a few extra points to bring up the low rating others have given it.Ps: The reason for a few of the low ratings is that they really couldve done without the cheap cgi and some bits they put in there just because they felt they should but they really didnt need to. For people who were expecting a lot of horror and gore and action of which Im sure there were a few were probably disappointed as they didnt care for a story or a little depth and a very relevant message that isnt brought up much.If you are even mildly interested in the old spooky tales in little towns and like a good story being told go ahead and take a chance at this unholy. Even as I sat and watched it its been better than most of the movies Ive seen at the cinemas the past few months.,10.0,2806
teocrito, Good premise but bad execution,It started off good. The story is different and the idea of a false virgin Mary can be interesting. The acting is acceptable and CGI average.However it fails to nail everything down. The last half of the movie is just a bunch of walking clichés. Its like they fired the writers they got and hired the cheapest ones. Very disappointing ending. Nothing we havent seen a thousand times before.,6.0,2807

I dont even mind a bit of suspension of belief because Im not expecting to see a documentary.The story was good the characters were developed and the effects were fine.

If you like supernatural horror this is a good example.The only thing that annoyed me was the f word used once unnecessarily presumably to help achieve the PG-13 rating.,10.0,2812
daveelmorto, An unholy good time,So if you are walking into this expecting a scarefest on the same level as Stigmata The Exorcist or Evil Dead you may as well not bother If you want to see an atmospheric dramatic suspenser then this is your movie. What could have been ridiculous in lesser hands is really effective and thought provoking with an interesting commentary on the media and the influence it has over so many. The scares are good and not over bearing and the performances are great.This being Executive Produced by Sam Raimi my expectations were high and easily met. Give it a go.,9.0,2813
paigetrevino, It was ok,"I recently saw the movie in theaters with my boyfriend as a date movie and I was presently surprised.

Overall its a good movie not one I would watch again but hood for one good watch.",7.0,2814
macgand, Decently Entertaining Horror Film,I found this movie to be solidly enjoyable overall. I wouldnt say that it was groundbreaking compared to the average horror move but there were a couple of things that make it stand out as a fun and interesting watch.The first is the mixture of humour alongside the more fearful and suspenseful elements. This is one of the best things about Sam Raimis movies-- there is often a surprising blend of fun and darkness in the tone.The second strength of the movie is its focus on the theme of cult mentalities. I liked that it dealt with this topic in a fairly believable fashion that emphasized the human elements of cult dynamics.Ultimately I got the sense that the movie wasnt trying to take itself too seriously. It provides a reasonably satisfying story and set of character arcs with some fun scares along the way. As long as a viewer isnt going into the movie and expecting total seriousness then the movie should make for pretty entertaining viewing.,8.0,2815

marshallfg, Pleasantly Surprised,I went in expecting your {now} standard possession/exorcism movie (you know lapsed/skeptic priest investigates a case of demonic possession. But after witnessing the subject talk dirty rearrange the furniture air peoples dirty laundry and show off their amazing contortionist skills said lapsed/skeptic priest becomes a true believer) but I actually enjoyed this movie. One surprise was the injection of humor. The other is that none of the events took place in a dark dungeon or on a dark and stormy night. Third even though the cast was full of unknowns (except the parish priest who Ive seen in other films) the acting was thoroughly natural and believable enough to keep me engaged. The main characters truly developed and evolved throughout the film. Finally the movie while never claiming to be anything other than fiction nevertheless contained a valuable message. I rarely go to theaters to watch movies anymore because streaming has been kinder to my pocketbook but I dont feel cheated .,6.0,2818

haydengaun, One of the best new horror movies of the last decade!,Id heard terrible reviews about this going in but I was certainly in for a pleasant surprise. While the movie does have a few rather predictable scenes theyre mingled with unexpected twists immensely effective jump scares and excellent character development. While a few minor characters acting may be a bit sub-par (which is never the fault of the top billed cast of course) the raw intensity of Jeffrey Dean Morgans character more than makes up for it. The CGI doesnt look the best at first since the initial scene that uses it is in a dream sequence but after that it is so realistic that you can scarcely tell that it wasnt done with live actors (it does however have an effect around it which serves to make it even more unnatural which some may find to look bad). A fantastic cast wonderful direction great writing and a terrifying antagonist all work in tandem to make this movie the best horror film Ive seen since The Empty Man. Its entertaining easy to follow and to be perfectly honest I dont remember the last time that an entire (socially distanced) theater full of people all jumped and screamed at the exact same time at an unexpected jumpscare. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Youll love it.,10.0,2821
SuperSlim451, The Unwatchable,"This movie was such a slow moving snail that I walked out before it ended. First time ever I walked out on a movie and Ive seen some bad movies but this one was so full of religious clichÃ©s and horror clichÃ©s it was like some high schooler looked at a ""how to write a horror religious movie"" and just did it word for word. I mean the big character is supposed to bet he girl that is supposed to be deaf and mute but within five minutes of the movie she is already talking so you cant even get invested in her. Then she just talks so much. Then you have the main guy that was supposed to be disgraced for writing some fake story that you never find out what its about and now hes this hot shot. I dont know maybe something happened at the end.I mean there is nothing about the characters that make you want to root for them see them succeed see them do anything. And the jump scares are all there. Every single one. I did rate it 2 stars though because there was one jump that made me jump. So there is at least that but other than that youd be better off skipping this for anything else. I had low expectations but it even fell way below those expectations. If you need a reason to sleep then this might be good enough but other than that... no.",2.0,2822

Maybe some effect could be done in practical ways instead of CGI but its still fair enough and it works. I recommend it a lot.",9.0,2824
ronterry55, A good horror movie!,Finally a good horror movie! I love scary movies dealing with the church and demons. The Unholy did not disappoint me. It played out from start to finish gradually building the suspense until the final moments. It told a story and there was an explanation for the demonic occurrences. A few jump scares added to the fun of watching the horror play out. The acting was decent especially Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Cricket Brown.Always nice to see Cary Elwes.I havent enjoyed a religious based horror movie this much since Midsommer in 2019.,9.0,2825

karlbehramfram, Watch this!!,The Cinematography on this movie is absolutely amazing. The way the scenes are cut together and the camera angles just makes this movie even better.I personally give this movie a solid 7. Its not cheesy or cliched as any other scary movies. The special effects are just right. The look and feel of the movie is also perfect. The camera angles shown here i havent seen in a long time and change the whole prespective of the movie. It feels like every camera angel is thought of before hand and planned in order to give justice to what is happening. I enjoyed it.Those who dont know the technical side of it wont enjoy it. For all you video editors out there have a look at the scenes. They are just brilliant.When the M logo for Metallica is seen on the cow there is a curch bell sound. I think its for the song For Whom The Bell Tolls. Then again its heard again later on. I dont know if its just me or did they do it on purpose. Nice touch.,7.0,2830

Ghost House Pictures does it again for this movie. Being a fan of the production company itself Ive always loved their films theyve made over the past 18 years. Jeffery Dean Morgan kills it as always. William Sadler who plays as Father Hagan Ive always seen in some movies here and there and hes great too. And Cricket Brown who plays Alice God I really hope to see her in more films. Shes outstanding! You cant go wrong with producer Sam Raimi when hes behind a horror movie.

But we saw the 1845 prologue so we know all is not what it seems.This is based on a novel by the late James Herbert a British horror writer and its a decent enough tale. A few more question marks in it wouldnt have been difficult to arrange and might have added a bit more texture because youre never in any great doubt about where the story is going.

lcobarruvias, Very good!,Ignore the negative reviews and go watch it!If you like scary movies youll like this one. It had a good story line without going overboard. You can definitely watch it with younger teens as theres nothing inappropriate about it.Is this going to win any awards? No of course not but its not meant to be an epic cinematic award winner. Its a scary movie with a pretty good story line to keep you entertained and engaged for an hour and a half or so. Now that theatres are opening back up go get some popcorn & candy and enjoy this movie for what it is.,10.0,2854
Umarfilmgeek, What more could you ask for from a horror film?,"Seriously why the low ratings?Everytime I watch a solid horror flick and I see low ratings I always say this at the start of a review. I am a huge horror fan.From a young age I snuck around my house finding my parents stash of horror video tapes and have been hooked ever since. I am no novice.Today was the first time in months I went to the cinema. And boy what a great movie to welcome me back.I wont go into an analysis and provide a commentary on the film after all thats what a trailer and a synopsis is about. I wont include any spoilers I will just tell people who enjoy horrors to watch this brilliant movie.Yes theres some clichÃ©s yes theres a couple of jump scares (not that many tbh) and no its not perfect. But the unholy is a masterful example of a solid horror film.It has a great backstory (yes a little predicable) but the lore is brilliant. The start of the movie is unnerving if you pay attention and that carries on throughout the film.The setting is brilliantly foreboding and the atmosphere is creepy as hell.The ""big bad"" of the film is creepy because it is so relavant to everything we see and encounter in this life. You just wonder who are we really trusting. The CGI is unnecessary but thats the only bad thing about it. The evil beings voice is actually quite scary in one if the particular scenes especially with the malice heard in its tone.Some creepy stuff happens during the course of the movie with some unnerving imagery and ideas that are very thought provoking. All in all I enjoyed this movie. It kept me invested from the beginning and to the end.If you appreciate a good story a horror that relies on that story and the imagery and not on jump scares youll love this. Its a great movie for those who like horror its a good movie for those who are scared of horrors too :). Even if you dont like horror. Give it a go. The 5.2 rating is currently has is absolutely ridiculous.I find critics annoying because they always rate mainstream movies were ""supposed to like"" very highly and crap on most horror movies and smaller offerings. Ignore them.Right enough waffling on. If you havent seen it go watch it. What are you waiting for? The virgin mary? ðŸ˜‰",10.0,2855
tvdefrancesco, Great Story Great Plot,I love the plot of this movie. In real life millions of people claim to see the Virgin Marie or claim to see statues of her crying tears or crying oil. What causes this phenomenon?Im glad this movie included this phenomenon. It was a great story. If the demon looked cooler I would have given it a 10 no doubt. Really enjoyed it though.,8.0,2856
gekkepoppetje, Today's directors don't know how to make people shudder,A poorly executed good idea. Todays directors dont know how to make people shudder. They think that if you show scary things that it will automatically become scary. Scary music sounds all the time. It is a weakness: if your storytelling or visually fails you use scary sounds. Drama and psychology are sacrificed for cheap jump scares. If you want to get scared at this level you better watch The exorcist or The Omen which are films that take the viewer and the theme seriously. The Unholy is just another failed fairground attraction from a country possessed by Christianity.,1.0,2857

I have no idea why he is allowed to act in serious movies if with his face he seems to be permanently in some kind of Leslie Nielsen satiric comedy. He completely ruins the atmosphere of the movie.But well there was not much to ruin the direction (a debut and you DO notice it) is really very bad and the movie is neither thrilling nor entertaining.",4.0,2870

This not the slasher gore horror movie type this one is more religious spirits related terror. Reviews with a 2 or 1 are unffair lets be honest and give the correct score because there is a lot of work and money involved and this particular movie do not deserve to get a 2 or a 3.Not all the movies are created to get the oscar some movies are done to give a good time watching them.,6.0,2882

om-34, Medicore and Offensive,"All right this film has a hearing actress playing the Deaf character. Of course there are many Deaf actors and actresses who can more or less speak. Marlee Matlin comes to mind. Why was the hearing actress cast for the Deaf character?The signing skills between two actresses are medicore. They appear to have learn the sign language from the ASL dictionary a few days prior to the shooting. Thus they do not sign fluently and naturally. Some signs they use are incorrect for the certain words.Whats more the term ""deaf and mute"" is used to describe her. For a long time the Deaf community has worked hard in educating the hearing community how archaic and offensive this term along with ""deaf and dumb"" is now. The Deaf people can communicate through the sign language or other forms of communication if they dont use voice or hear. Just dont call them ""deaf and mute"" or ""deaf and dumb""! Its same for the ""hearing impaired"" in the plot and synopsis. This term denotes the medical condition that indicates something is wrong with them and needs the intervention through surgery (cochlear implants etc.) or through oralism (speech therapy lipreading and hearing training etc.). Deaf people dont like this term at all because theres nothing wrong with them per se.Now about the film. This horror flick is highly formulaic and repetitive: evil spirit is trapped in the object and is released when somebody accidentally or intentionally breaks the seal. The Catholic Church delegates come to investigate the ""miracles"" and end up exploiting the ""miracles"" for their own gain. Nothing new under the sun.This film has higher-than-usual 8 9 and 10 stars with very short reviews. In other words those reviewers are paid to post the ""excellent"" reviews for the medicore film with equally medicore CGI and acting. I would have given the film at least five stars if it wasnt for miscast of hearing actress for poor signing skills and for the offensive terms.",1.0,2886

seige-hound, Sunday School Lesson disguised as a horror movie,Listen I have no issue with religious themes in movies including horror movies. One of my favourite films is the Conjuring which is also very heavy handed in its religious themes. However The Unholy takes the cake in this regard to the point where the film ends with a Bible verse as if it was an episode of VeggieTales.So the Unholy follows two main characters a down on his luck journalist who makes ends meet by working for a shady conspiracy website and a young deaf woman who inexplicably gains the ability to hear and speak and credits the Virgin Mary as the source of this healing.The film is more or less a parable about false prophets and healthy skepticism even within religion. One of the side characters is in fact a priest who is hired by the Vatican to approach the alleged miracles committed by the Virgin Mary with a sense of skepticism. In this film God exists but is a more distant measured version while the Devil takes the initiative and pretends to be God to fulfill his misdeeds. This moral is very heavy handed which leads more atheistic horror fans such as myself wondering if Im the intended audience or if this is a very misguided attempt at making a movie to show at Youth Group.Aside from this theres a few other issues with the film. The main antagonist the false Virgin Mary is not very scary. In fact the design of the character is very odd especially after she is unmasked at the end looking like a cartoony version of Red Skull. The creators of the film get around this design flaw with copious amounts of jump scares which begs the question as to why any of the main characters believe that the false Mary is the real Mary in the first place if every second or so she is jump scaring one of the main characters.However I will give the film credit for at least having a bit of imagination and not being as ashamed of its religious themes as many other supernatural horror movies out there are. This film at least has some gusto to name drop the Virgin Mary Jesus and God which is surprisingly rare in these movies. Even in movies where the Catholic Church features heavily movie producers seem to try and fenagle their ways around being explicit in their themes in order to not offend or alienate anyone but this movie does the opposite. It is a very Catholic very Christian movie for better and for worse.I didnt hate it probably as much as I should but it could have been a lot better.,5.0,2892
piercedtat, It could of been great,Good story and good acting but what completely ruins it like so many other movies is the cheap badly done cgi.

syd9907, The 5 Stars are ONLY for Andra Day's Performance,"I watched ""The United States vs Billie Holiday"" on Hulu and this film literally left me drained. Andra Day nails her portrayal of Billie Holiday. She is sensational. But this film showcases what happens when a great performance ends up in an absolutely awful film.The only time The United States vs Billie Holiday comes to life is when Andra Day is on-screen. She took trite dialogue and made it magic. And her version of Billie Holidays songs were powerful but when she sang ""Strange Fruit"" it gave me chills.This biopic about the last years in Holidays life and how the authorities pursued and harassed her just because she refused to stop singing ""Strange Fruit"" is as average as it is lethargic. There is no real direction and Lee Daniels got lost and never found his way out of the weeds. There was no tension no reason to be invested in any of these characters except Billie Holiday and that was fully due to Andra Day. Then you had a way over-the-top dogs funeral Roy Cohn ( Senator Joseph McCarthys chief counsel) and an insinuated lesbian relationship between Holiday and actress Tallulah Bankhead. Who knows if they had a thing....this film was splintering off in every direction imaginable and it never found its center.This was an ambitious film that never fulfilled its potential. Though Daniels has found his his niche in some areas but this is not that niche. A truly skilled director and writer could have made a masterpiece but Daniels and Suzan-Lori Parks who wrote this schlock never made the story and vision they had in their heads come to life and thats a pity because the subject matter was there. I sincerely hope that Day wins an award for her performance because she deserves it for making sweet tasting lemonade out of a hot mess of a film.",5.0,2902

rafajack-56549, A bad script vs. Billie Holiday,"I read another review that said pretty much everything I wanted to say so Ill try to be concise. One could say that the movie is more about ""look how Andra Day looks and talks and sings like Billie Holiday"" than about the artists life I mean we all heard her songs a thousand times over the years do we really need so many musical numbers? We have the records silly! Its just a bunch of scenes stuck together with almost no continuity for 2 hours not that linearity is a must for any picture but if youre telling the story of a person that actually lived you might as well have some right? Andra Day is amazing and I hope she gets nominated for an Academy Award! That said go watch Lady Sings The Blues or read Billies autobigraphical book with the same name.",3.0,2904

caramia2002," Better to Watch ""Lady Sings the Blues""",Which is scant praise indeed as that Billie Holiday biopic was mostly a Diana Ross vehicle complete with cover tunes. And while she gave an enjoyable Oscar nominated performance the film really sold Holiday and especially her music short. It should be noted that most of the lyrics of Strange Fruit were omitted. So much so that I didnt even get that song when watching the film upon its release.But this film puts Strange Fruit right although it takes an agonizing hour and a half to hear it. But it does little else right. Its a huge huge disappointment. Within the first 5 minutes we have terrible acting (Jimmys mom clearly dubbed) a very kludgey script and lots and lots of ho-hum-ness. Hard to believe that this was directed by the same person who did The Butler and Empire.It seems as if the director was trying to make a highly stylized tongue in cheek film about Holidays legal and political problems and thus a less than obvious statement about Americas sketchy racial past. Instead its too obvious gratuitously anachronistic as if only to please modern (young) audiences and otherwise useless. With two count em two big budget high profile biopics about Holiday youd think one could get her right esp this one with the benefit of hindsight help from the first film.Andra Day is fine as an elegant Holiday and my few stars are for her and some of the other cast. The sets and costumes are great if much out of time. Days gowns are real eye candy for sure and Day is stunning from her perfect hair down to her perfect shoes. Unfortunately none of this makes the plodding clumsy retread rote grade school wokeness (and Im usually all about woke but cant we have a smart grown up approach?) of this film worth it. Huge waste of money talent and Billie Holidays memory. Please would somebody get her legacy on film right someday????,3.0,2908
LProductions-837-667666, Another lost opportunity,Billie Holiday has been dead for more than 60 years and no one yet has managed to create a decent biographic film of her sad squalid and too-brief life.The first - and biggest problem - is a screenplay riddled with errors inaccuracies and clichés. As other have noted it makes this unwatchable (I started to fast-forward about 90 minutes in).The production itself - despite its voyeuristic obsession with sex and violence - looks like it came from Disney. I feel disgusted to use this word but it has been whitewashed beyond comprehension.Andra Day gives a credible performance and does an decent imitation of Holidays voice but its all technique and no soul.I can speak with some authority on the disarray of her life: for 12 years I worked for the record company which owns the rights to a huge amount of her prime recordings and the first that issued a 10-CD box when digital technology was new. I got caught up in the legal battles over the royalties to her recordings a nasty greedy affair by people who never met her only adding another sad chapter to her legacy.,2.0,2909

goldenlampshade," Andra Day dresses, sings, and acts this tragic part perfectly",This movie would make a great triple feature with Ma Raineys Black Bottom and Judas and the Black Messiah for showcasing racism and injustice systemic and culturally nakedly and honestly. The US vs. Billie Holiday really makes you frustrated in all the right ways and at all the right people but also inspires people like me who didnt know much about this history to learn more and educate oneself since those who dont learn from history...anyway...Andra Day gives an incredible performance and Trevante Rhodes balances the line of someone you want to smack in the face one second and kiss the next. Impeccable gowns and hairstyling add to the glamor and realism of the music being sung so beautifully by her swingin emotional voice. Day expresses a lot in those eyes tender one minute and giving diva the next. Maybe its not perfect from a filmmaking point of view but not in any innegligible way and the image of Andra Day screaming with joy and pride in her Golden Globe acceptance speech is enough to make me feel good inside knowing she gave this her all and that her idol would be proud.,10.0,2918

There is nothing gratuitous about the sex scenes: they are true-to-form for someone who has suffered early sexual abuse. The period look is fine.

I realize that I like nothing that Lee Daniels is involved with. He changed who Billie Holiday was. The sex was too much. I just didnt understand why some of the scenes were in the movie. I think Lee Daniels secretly hates women. Watch it for Ms Day. If you want to know what Billie Holiday was about Amazon has a great documentary about her.,5.0,2922

tygarr13," Great, Gritty, and Painfully Realistic.",U.S. vs Billie Holiday is an excellent yet unabashedly realistic and insightful fictional portrayal of the life loves and tribulations endured by Lady Day a victim of the circumstances of her upbringing and personal demons. It seems almost incongruous to include Ms Andra Days jaw-dropping performances (singing and acting) perfect sets and period accoutrements with the dark American realities of racial prejudice segregation lynchings and Billie Holidays ongoing unethical no holds barred racially-motivated persecution by the US government. For singing a song!The U.S. vs Billie Holiday is a great must-see film that I a Black American almost passed on because I am wearying of one of the painful shrouded negative truths of African American history being constantly illuminated for entertainment purposes: famous and revered Black American icons (Billie Holiday Fred Hampton Malcolm X) persecuted by the US government while simultaneously betrayed (sometimes murdered) by their own (reminiscent of the adage Crabs in a Basket). This is my own personal feeling and please note that I would not change any part of this incomparable presentation.Thank you Andra Day Lee Daniels and HULU.,10.0,2927
Quinoa_Chris_Kirk, Historical recreation with no dramatic structure,"Jazz singer Billie Holliday struggles with addiction to heroin and men while being persistently harassed by the FBI for racist reasons.A spectacularly impressive recreation of a historical milieu with settings costumes make-up ways of speaking and cultural attitudes supremely realistic and immersive. Every scene is a magnificently composed world but together they form no cohesive narrative no complex thematic expression apart from a recreation in popular form of a racist history and no interesting trajectory for a complex inspirational talented woman apart from self-destruction and degeneration. There is no depth no overarching motivation no transformation just a pain explained in flashbacks of trauma. Like her controversial song ""Strange Fruit"" the painful and shameful recent history of racist America is being revealed but is Hollidays strength and talent and legacy being honoured is her story being given the depth it deserves? Andra Days performance is the same extremely impressive on the surface powerfully lucid within an individual scene but no dramatic shape. Perhaps the screenplay is to blame. It amounts to a glossy surface and no heart.The films political theme is clear: lynchings have not yet been banned even if her song about them was. But the more intimate theme is perhaps akin to Asif Kapadias powerful documentary Amy: that we from our distance though the veil of the media have some empathy and patience for the particular and real challenges faced by those who pour themselves into music for us.",6.0,2928
jhannahcowboybebop, A Poorly Executed and Confusing Film,The United States vs Billie Holiday is the highly anticipated film on the legendary singer meant to explore her life and struggles against the US government. Unfortunately it comes off as are confusing and poorly executed film directed by Lee Daniels. Lee Daniels attempts to distract a biopic on the legendary singer but unfortunately seems to be confused about the time he wants to make. He doesnt know whether or not to make a film on the legendary singer and her life and struggles or a commentary on the drug war and it shows and over shadows the piece. What doesnt help matters is the cinematography of the film which looks like into a TV movie and not a theatrical release which is sad because it has a great cast to make this work. If youre looking for a film that talks about the historical aspects of her life then please focus your attention elsewhere. Understand that when it comes to films based on people that actually lived dramatic license will be taken thats just a fact. In this case the mountain historical inaccuracies are too much to ignore.Of the fault of the film none should fall on the cast which does an incredible job in the roles that they are given especially day as Billie Holiday herself. The work shes put in to create her own portrayal of holiday shines through and its a highlight of the film. Her talents the talents of the cast in general are wasted in this confused mess that chooses to focus more the physical abuse from her male lovers and drug use and not her actual struggles with the government due to her song Strange Fruit. Again if youre looking for a film about the life of Billie Holiday to watch please turn your attentions elsewhere,2.0,2929
imbarrand, Oscar worthy,Andra day deserves an Oscar for this performance. What a debut! Its a gritty and genuine portrayal of what happened.

Mostly the US governs fixation on white supremacy and stifling any freedoms of Black freedom or acknowledgment.

First let me take my hat off to the casting it was outstanding starting with Andra Day performance which nothing short of a showstopping in her portrayal of the late great singer Billie Holiday hands down one of the best if not the best performance this year and we have had some great ones by some newcomers. The writing was tops and Days singing was in a leagued by itself. The story-line was driving kept my attention throughout the movie and this one will be added to my library.

The script. The ACTING. Im so astonished by Andra Day...for her to have never acted before and then step into this role and completely incarnate Billie Holiday in this manner is absolutely crazy to me.The other cast members delivered as well.Lee Daniels has a way about directing fresh talent that puts said talent on the map and make no mistake...theres a reason Andra is already being nominated for the top awards in the industry.

wolfcooky, Rebel with a Cause!,"This is one movie that made me a little angry. I know about Billie Holiday and I have seen Lady Sings the Blues (which fails in comparison to this version). This depiction was ""raw"" and seems to be more fact based. That not withstanding I thought this was a excellent depiction of her life and the struggles that most blacks had to endure with a government that still has systemic racism.This is a movie about freedom of speech and a society that tries to silence that speech. It was in a time pre Medgar Evers Malcolm X Martin Luther King Jr. and others who had the same opposition.Some film critics have attacked the technical aspect of the film and the storyline however the message is clear. Just as in the book ""Free from Slavery not Free From Racism"" this problem still exists in 2021 as it did in the 1940s and 50s for people of color.I would highly recommend this movie for women and people of color.

obrienigm, Great performance from Adra Day let down by weak script.,This films characters and storytelling are sacraficed for the sake of the film makers polemic. Not that there is anything wrong with that polemic its a worthy and interesting one but it should have supported the story not replaced it. Characters constantly come and go with no explanation or depthIt is nicely filmed costumes and sets are impressive and Day gives a award winning nuanced and subtle performance but all this is undermined by the weak and clumsy narrative and the cardboard cutout characters that populate the rest of the film.Its a shame because a black icon like Billie Holiday deserved a film that celebrated her achievements and courage with a script as strong as Andra Days performance.,5.0,2940
nave-25931, Pain Through Song,"I wont lie I was in thence at first since I really dont know too much about Billie Holidays life story and only knew a little about her music. I did read that it picked up right as she went into prison for ""narcotics use"". I know previous movies went in and explained her start but this was about why she was the way she was how she was the voice of her people American people who were being burned and lynched. The. Government couldnt blame her for singing but they could for drugs so its the suppression of making a statement but wrapped in a blanket rule breaking when it was blatant racism. I will say it starts slow and if you dont know her life you are getting an eyes wide view of a ""junkie"" but quickly escalates and you can see that sang people paid attention. Spoiler alert here: I watch horror movies and so in that context not much makes me jump but the scene when Billie stumbles onto a family whose house was burned and children crying because their parent was lynched just watching as the words ""justice served"" shocked me. I still feel stunned and the feeling she felt and why she was the way she was just made sense why she pushed through and sang her song. Whats more horrific is that anti-lynching laws have never passed congress to this day . You just feel like you know her through song and Andra Day did a terrific job conveying a story who lived a tragic life but left a piece of her soul through her music. Give it a chance it will hopefully open you up to why ""Strange Fruit"" was epic to understanding civil inhumanity and why it needed/needs to be heard.",10.0,2941
adog2001, Doesn't Even Feel Like A Hulu Movie,I saw this with my mom today and I really enjoyed it. While I am no hard-core fan of Billie Holiday I did know a little bit about her so that was why I chose to watch this. I gotta say I wasnt disappointed at all watching this. It talks about her drug life and her life during the time she sang a certain song about the slaughtering of black people at the time. Tbh this movie really didnt not feel like a Hulu movie it felt more like a movie that could come out in theaters but couldnt obviously due to the Covid pandemic. Overall if you like Billie Holiday or anything old time or old time singers check it out. You will enjoy it. 8 out of 10 for me.,8.0,2942

I love how everytime white people see the harsh truths about this country they automatically try to invalidate the experience. The facts were presented and while yall saw a political agenda(whatever that even means) I saw an experience that has affected black Americans since the beginning of this country.

jaimehberrio66," Great Actress, Not so great movie",Let me start by saying that Andra Day as Billie Holiday delivered an amazing performance. I only watched this film because of her Oscar nomination and it really shows how much work she put into the character; nomination totally deserved. However the rest of the film is a mess to say the least. The screenplay is unbearable and makes you want to skip much of the story because it is all over the place. The directing and the editing simply werent right for the story they were trying to tell. I am personally not familiar with the work of Billie Holiday beyond the movie however I have done some research into her life and I think this story deserves another chance a better adaptation into what was a tragic and impactful life.,5.0,2955
VideoConnoisseur, Two-for-One,"This film is two-for-one: (1) engaging movie and (2) live concert. As USA Today critic Brian Truitt wrote ""Because Daniels filmed her singing live Strange Fruit and other old songs feel vibrant and resonant."" What other movie songs are performed and recorded live? It is ground-breaking. Sumptuous sets contrast with no-frills emotions of Billie Holiday and her entourage. . . Costumes furnishings and production values noted in the mainstream press would display well on large theater screens the way director Lee Daniels intended but watching online has its advantages. Subtitles and the ability to rewind rescue the many one-liners of the fast-paced dialogue. The United States vs. Billie Holiday is no light popcorn fare. It is an intense and dark journey of celebrity targeted by authorities determined to make an example selfish hangers-on drug pushers and abusive men. A light romance fantasy conjured from artistic license counters the harsh reality documented by the film . . . Enjoy a final live performance and floaty dream reunion a la Titanic in the closing credits. Bravo Lee Daniels and co!",9.0,2956
jmstm, A Fatal Flaw,"I have to mark this film way down for calling Strange Fruit ""her song."" Billie Holiday is certainly associated with it more than any other but she did not write the lyrics and calling it her song is a very serious error of judgement by director Lee Daniels. Her ownership in the public mind or even in her own mind is one thing but for the filmmaker to make the claim in the manner he did (on a text slate to start the film) is essentially fatal for the film.The writer of the song is Abel Meeropol aka Lewis Allan. Meeropol son of Russian Jewish immigrants seems an interesting person in his own right. In addition to writing what has been called the American song of the century he apparently also taught high school English to James Baldwin and adopted and raised the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg famously executed by the U. S. in 1953 as spies for the Soviet Union.By that accounting alone he seems like a character who would bring interest to a movie. According to her Wikipedia page Holiday claimed in her book Lady Sings the Blues that she co-wrote the music to the song with Meeropol. Unless that claim has been proven false this would have been an entirely appropriate scene for the film given its heavy focus on the song.Daniels ought to have pressed himself to rise to occasion and do right by Meeropol instead of trying to do him out of his claim to fame.",4.0,2957

aalreetmarra, Andra Day vs Diana Ross,"I was ten years old when Billie Holiday died but it was not until a few years later years I would listen to Billie Holiday. In 1972 I was 23 years old and in anticipation I went to the Cinema to watch Lady Sings the Blues I came away feeling disappointed so Im a little puzzled by reviewers holding up that film as better than ""The United States vs Billie Holiday as one film is a biopic and the other focuses on one period?As ""Lady Sings the Blues opens we see Diana Ross being thrown into a padded cell and immediately I notice that the hairstyle is instantly recognizable as Diana Ross and not Billie Holiday? Today many films based on the truth you find Directors selecting an actor who at least resembles the person they are portraying and this is what I see when I watch Andra Day playing Billie Holiday.Both these artists are great singers in their genre but Diana Ross has a much sweeter tone in her vocal not to mention that she also has a much wider range which in truth the real Billie Holiday did not have. On the other hand Andra Day has that huskiness to her voice that the real Billie Holiday also had at this point go to YouTube and listen to Billie Holiday singing ""All of Me then listen to Diana Ross and then listen to Andra Day. Diana Ross sang the song she didnt render it like Billie Holiday when Andra Day sings that song she makes the effort to include the inflection and phrasing that Billie Holiday had in her vocal.Diana Ross was only nominated for a Golden Globe for her role but today Andra Day was nominated for a Golden Globe and also won it there is the difference! In 1972 Lady Sings the Blues came in at the bottom of the Top Ten movies for that year grossing about $19720490 in North America to date bear in mind that the budget was $15000000 and to give some perspective the Top Movie for 1972 grossed $93300000.As for The United States vs Billie Holiday believe it or not the clue is in the title Billie Holiday was one of many prominent African Americans to be targeted by Edgar J. Hoovers F.B.I. yes this is the subject of this period of Billie Holidays life. It is not a biopic of her whole life a fact that Lee Daniels stated in the press before the release of the movie. One has written they couldnt watch the movie and turned it off? How can you review it then? Another writes it is only when Andra Day is on the screen that the film is lifted? Given that she is in the starring role I dont find this surprising? Another doesnt like the portrayal of Billie being a victim but she was a victim of the F.B.I. she was manipulated and ripped off by men in her life and no doubt beaten up on occasion. However she had a hard life from childhood upwards in the time that she lived in America was an openly racist society but not just that it was a two-tier society and African Americans were right at the bottom of that second tier. Being born a woman from her sort of background in this time was yet another disadvantage she came from nothing achieved fame in this discriminately racist period her lifestyle was one of music which will more than likely put you in the proximity of alcohol and drugs it comes with the territory.As for the movie moving back and forth through time this is not a new feature many other biopics are filmed in this way you wont find one that is 100% accurate Hollywood is known for embellishments to make the story more appealing to audiences so cut some slack and get real.For this movie to be currently given a score of 6.3 is disgraceful its not perfect but I rate it at 8 out of 10 as one reviewer stated the music went on too long the film dragged missing the point that Billie was a musician and I agree with others here that the music throughout the film was nothing short of outstanding!",8.0,2960
evanston_dad, Did Learn Some Things,"I did actually learn some things about Billie Holiday that I didnt know namely that her song ""Strange Fruit"" was an anthem for racial injustice and that the FBI used drugs as an excuse to relentlessly pursue her so that they could arrest her and keep her from performing thereby depriving her the opportunity to incite black audiences. That is the actually very intriguing kernel around which this biopic is structured but its diluted by the hot mess of this films screenplay that spends far too much time on Holidays tumultuous relationships with various men in her life.One of those men is FBI agent Jimmy Fletcher whos assigned the task of following Holiday around and catching her out. Hes black himself and is subjected to the racial hierarchy within the department so over time his allegiances switch to Holiday and he becomes her ally. Again this is actually an interesting parallel story. But again its also diluted by everything else going on in this muddled movie.Why for example is the character of Talullah Bankhead and the possible lesbian relationship she had with Holiday even in the film? That story is introduced and literally goes nowhere as if whole sections of the movie were edited out at the last minute. And why do all the white FBI agents have to be played as caricature villains as if we wont sympathize enough with the black people unless the white people are as cartoonishly awful as possible. And why does the screenplay feel the need to have characters just tell us what the movies themes are without allowing us to come to conclusions ourselves? At one point a black character tells the worst of the FBI agents that the department hates Holiday because shes black and beautiful and threatening (or words to that affect) to which my response was ""well duh.""And there are ridiculous sex scenes and lots of scenes of people using drugs and getting beat up and yelling and fighting. None of this bothered me because of the content but rather because it all just becomes monotonous and traffics in the most tired of biopic tropes.Andra Day gives an impressive performance that stands as probably the films biggest asset.

Her main crime was that she insisted on singing the inflammatory song "" Strange fruit "" describing the lynching of blacks. Till her death she took a defiant stand and refused to cow down to FBI agents.The film is made well and Andra Day carries it splendidly on her shoulders. Her acting also improves as the film develops and the ending scenes see her emoting superbly.Lee Danielss direction is admirable.

claddagh72, 4 stars for Andra Day only,I started wondering while watching this if anyones ever put together a list of worst bio pics with best lead actor/actress performances.

She works every word in the miserable script with nuance and a wealth of emotion worthy of a blues singer. Her performance of Strange Fruit is as haunting as the song.The movie itself what a hot mess. Let me count thy ways:A jumble of scenes that seem oddly sequenced.The point of the movie (the government stopping at no means to keep Holiday from singing Strange Fruit a protest song against lynching) is so dumbed down it takes away from the true evil of whats happening.We dont get to see more of Holidays childhood and how those experiences shaped her drug use and future abusive relationships since theyre key to the story.Billie Hol,4.0,2974

joeynos, Wow!! Not what you expected.,This was a difficult movie to watch on a number of levels. I did not not how tragic Billie holidays life was nor how disgusting the US government Painted this woman as their pariah. Ms Days performance hits it out of the park. Superb!! I did have some Germaine story and directorial issues with this movie. The star shine and very worthy Oscar nomination in this movie is without a doubt Andra Day.,8.0,2976
lanell-24-456153," Very slow movie, too slow for me",This story is important and could/should have been told better. An important aspect is that in 1937 democrats controlled the senate 79-19 over the republicans. The lynching bill couldnt survive the democratic senate. Plus FDR was president another democratic hurdle. Did you also know that an anti-lynching bill was not successfully put into law until 2020 under President Trump!? It took over 100 years and a Republican to finally get this bill passed.,5.0,2977

Osibob," Miss Day Shines despite ""Stormy Weather""",The screenplay was too on the nose and quite frankly poorly written. Miss Day played a good Holiday; especially with regards to her singing voice.

Finishing the movie in retrospect I asked myself: WTF just happened??? The only answer my super ego dictated was that I wasted another 1:30 hrs of my life due to not responding to my gut feeling that its a trap!I really wanted to like this movie but I couldnt. 5 stars for cinematography and Hopkins performance zero for everything else except Abbie Cornishs performance that is -2!If you find this review unhelpful (which is a sorta true) then imagine your disappointment when you watch this movie!

jaimegonzales210," Entertaining, but dumb","It was not the worst movie I have ever seen but the plot was incredibly dumb. The utterly ridiculous premise about super-assassins being sent to kill each other or just one while they operate without any clue regarding evidence DNA or other real world issues. Also the entire premise of hiring an assassin then making them guess who the target is seems pretty stupid. What assassin would take such a job and what idiot pays money to maybe have the wrong person(s) killed?The plot holes are enormous.The premise of the movie is that the Virtuoso is a professional assassin who is remorseful for an accidental killing. His Mentor for whatever reason decides he needs to be dead but instead of just killing him when he had ample opportunity the Mentor devises a complex scheme whereby 4 killers are sent on a mission to kill *someone* for *some reason*. Each other? Just him?In the near-final scene where the Virtuoso meets his killer they discuss inane issue. The *Deputy* could not be made to look like he was killed by bad guys because he had the real Deputys body in the trunk of the Sheriffs vehicle. The police would not overlook that when investigating the fake Deputys death.The guy who had a heart attack induced had several fake IDs in his wallet leaving only one at random would not fool police into thinking he was just some poor schmuck it would they would discover it was fake he had a gun etc. Hilarity ensues.The final living killer is just as nonsensical as he is. Apparently to the writer getting away with murder is a common and easy experience requiring very little in way of not leaving evidence. She has sex with the Virtuoso which makes no sense if she knows she will kill him takes a shower allowing the Virtuoso to find her passport and figure out who she is. She then kills him after their ridiculous *one-professional-killer-to-another* conversation goes to his house feeds his dog and and nearly shoots it but changes her mind.The plot makes me wonder which one of the actors read it and thought ""that is possible and could happen in real life I would like to be a part of this.""Donnie Darko is not real but it isnt supposed to be and is an entertainment masterpiece. The Virtuoso is supposed to be something that could happen in real life is a trainwreck of unrealistic logic and events and generally is not very good.Plus the ending sucked. They could have ended it like the Mechanic where he died but everyone else also gets killed by his revengeful nature.",4.0,2994
bombersflyup," Watchable, not great.",The Virtuoso is all a bit of a mystery and for that reason works to a degree but not amounting to much in the end.Im not sure why any of this was happening or why he would accept this sort of position.

The fact that the plot is again laid out at the end of the film shows how dumb they expect the average audience to be.Most viewers today want/expect witty one-liners big explosions and long drawn-out car chases ... but that is not what happens in the real world so it does not happen in the movie. This movie tells it like it is; cold dark and lonely.In short if you did not enjoy it it was not made for you and you are the one that made the choice to waste your time.,8.0,2997

housearrestedever, Once you decided to use voice over to,"Replace the thoughts of the characters itd be a disastrous wrong step to start a movie; its so lame and so lazy to use such stupid method to almost every scene and setting in this movie.Besides Anson Mount who played the Virtuoso role was not an ideal pick for it. Mount still implemented his aura when he played the fierce character in ""Hell on Wheels"" as totally inappropriate. A hitman or assassin should not show his intensity everytime when he was in a social contact with the common people. He just looked so different and stand out among regular people he didnt blend in but a rooster among hens; thats an absolute NO NO in the first place. Hes so intense and looked so obviously intense with animosity to others only made him look so unprofessional. Then again signed up Abbie Cornish to play the diners waitress was another misstep unforgivable but even so shes more looked like a seasoned virtuoso than Mount who played it. But Cornish really has to watch out her weight it seems a bit of out of control and readily to explode. Hawkins well this movie got to borrow some heavy wt. Actor to fool viewers to think that this movie would be great but not in the least. Hes not a magician or savior to salvage a terrible screenplay with limited budget for a B movie and Id guess a large part of the budget was paid to him for his participation. As to Mr. Mount your performance was just too 1 dimensional you couldnt just bring your Hell on Wheels characteristics into any other roles you played. Youre a handsome dude but it could only bring you so far.Summary: Dont waste your time like I did; dont bother.",1.0,2999

Not only that but the accident I saw on the screen probably would have a 95% chance of survival for the driver. The 2nd hit is just a code name a location and a time. He has no idea who hes supposed to off so he has to go around asking everyone he meets if theyve heard of this code name? Are you kidding me? And even then the ""code name"" is meaningless.

javierbaron2008, The '' virtuoso '' in the art of killing,"The Virtuoso (2021) Dir. Nick StaglianoMovies about hit men there are many. What is interesting here is the use of the protagonists voice-over that shows us his skill efficiency intelligence meticulousness and amorality to kill in cold blood. He calls himself ""Virtuous"" in the killing trade.The first 15 minutes are great. The voice-over sets the murderers introspective and melancholic tone. A very good guy at what he does that shows a certain fatigue and a nascent guilt for some ""collateral damage"" in his murderous career and for the low-profile life that his job forces him to lead. Followed by a remarkable monologue of the character played by Anthony Hopkins recounting a massacre in which he participated in his days as a soldier in the Vietnam War. A reflection on how coldness and amorality is brewed in people who make the death of others their way of life.He is assigned a somewhat uncertain mission in which he does not know exactly the person he must eliminate. This leads him to a restaurant in a small town nestled in the mountains.A waitress an older man a couple and a policeman.Who of them is his target? Being a guy who goes through life like a wolf in sheeps clothing he will have to use all of his experience and insight against people who also camouflage his identity and intentions.A game of false appearances that shows that even the most cold and calculating people are prone to moments of vulnerability.Interesting reflection on the  virtuous  in the art of killing who refuse to surrender completely to the brief flashes of love that cross their paths and the vicious circle of loneliness in which they are trapped.",8.0,3013

Hopkins Morse Marsan etc. Barely make their presence felt.

I think that the things they left out would have clarified and explained a lot of the behaviors of Anna and Ethan. For example they showed the car crash but didnt talk about the fact that Anna was stranded for days in that storm watching her family die (which was the cause of her agoraphobia and PTSD). We kind of saw Anna and Ethans relationship but it wasnt really believable. We werent shown enough of their relationship to understand how Ethan manipulated Anna into trusting him and believing he was the victim. The movie also completely skimmed over the details of the guesswhoanna account (how it was Ethan on Annas computer but Anna being under the influence of the meds and alcohol thought that she had created and sent the emails to herself).... and the movie didnt even mention Annas conversation with her online ""friend"" (who ended up actually being Ethan). Oh and then there was Bina Annas friend..... I could go on and on.If they had included more details from the book sure the movie might have been longer but it would have made more sense. It definitely would have been a LOT more intense and mind-blowing like the book was.",5.0,3047
daviddunn-90653, Could Have Been Better,This was watchable but it had the potential to be so much better. The movie started off very well but unfortunately descended into farce. For me the best thing about this was the cat who played a starring role.,3.0,3048

larrydelacruzph, Not Disappointed,From the release delays to the bad word of mouth I was expecting this to be a trainwreck of a movie. Instead what I got was a perfectly enjoyable suspense thriller. Sure its has its flaws the first half seems rushed and some actors were underutilized (Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular) but I did not see that final twist coming - a twist that actually made sense.I have not read the book but even if I had its only fair to judge this as a separate piece of work - because it is. So even if the book WAS better its got nothing to do with this piece of entertainment to me for they are two completely different experiences. Kudos to this film for not sucking.,7.0,3050
profun77, Random puzzle with no real meaning,The plot itself ads nothing new and the so-called twist is anything but a twist - it could be seen coming from the very beggining of the movie.And THAT fight scene came directly from the worst of the worst horror movies. Totally unconvincing unrealistic and weird run of the mill so-called thriller.,4.0,3051

kdogg-64613, Bummer,Im normally a fan of Amy Adams. Some reviews say shes great in this movie but I felt like its her worst performance.The movie was lifeless.

jeromhartmann, Rear window + the girl in the train + shutter island,"Starts out as Rear Window has a Shutter Island plot twist in the middle ends as a combination of Rear Window and The Girl On The Train. Probably several things went wrong in the production and the script was probably modified several times. Some top actors like Gary Oldman and Anthony Mackie play pretty insignificant roles. The film just feels off and when the final twist arrives youre like ""thats it...?"". The last 10 minutes of the movie is literally spend on the main character leaving the house and taking a taxi. I understand that this is important because the character finally dares to go outside but you as a viewer will not be interested by then. Seriously dont watch this watch any of the other three films mentioned.",2.0,3057

lizxypopcornkid," It's ok , but I'm disappointed",The book is very well written and this film is a very poor adaptation.There are seriously important plot points that they skip out on all together and I was incredibly disappointed with the emphasis upon her condition (agoraphobia) being very little.Some visuals throughout which r due to her condition will make little to no sense as her condition isnt very well explained.Plus I think the sevens when she is on drugs and drinking were overly emphasised in an attempt to build tension that didnt really work.This film will be good if you havent read the book and underwhelming if you have.Overall I think the adapted parts they have done are well done the acting is great( especially Amy Adams wyatt Russel and Fred Hechinger)but Im very disappointed in the way this movie was handled.The director had a chance to bring attention to a rare condition and to make a great movie and sort of blew it by not completely following the book or detailing certain points.In other words its a clusterfuk.,4.0,3059
ShanC22, Satisfying adaptation of a great book,First of all I cannot understand the reviews from critics being SO harsh? I had read reviews pre-watching and was expecting a train wreck but was very pleasantly surprised. They clearly did not read the book or watch the trailer to see the style the movie was taking before watching.Personally I loved the style of the film the colour pallette and the set. It absolutely lived up to the book in my opinion- its completely unrealistic to expect every detail from a novel to be included in a 2 hour film anything that was left out did not effect the storyline.The performances were great all round the only negative I can say is that there werent enough scenes/screen time with the side characters- however this may be down to the extensive reshoots and reworking the film went through.I loved the ending it really gave the feeling of a classic horror/thriller but through a more modern lense.I highly recommend this movie think people are being unreasonably harsh and bitter.,8.0,3060

This is the umpeeth unfunny movie by the married duo.After the first 30 minutes I simply had the movie on in the background but could still hear McCarthys ad-libs which were excruciatingly awful.If this is the best an immensely talented actress like Octavia Spencer has to pick from thats a sad commentary on the state of comedic films.

They dont.Special effects are pretty good.Around the halfway point I realised it wasnt going to go anywhere and I started to get bored.For me the big saving grace and the reason for my 5 star rating is Jason Bateman.

charlotteweb-43346, Is this movie worth watching? Quick Answer: No.,"Long Answer: Definitely not. You dont have to read this review because its just not worth it.First of all Melissa McCarthys character (Im too lazy to call her by her name so well call her Melissa) tries to pull of the ""village idiot"" stunt in the most embarassing way and comes off selfish and almost bully-like to Octavia Spencers character. She also makes fun of nerds/ ""smart"" people even to Octavias daughter which is a really boring and overused trope. At some point she even feels entitled to know about Octavias life (such as the existence of her daughter) even though Melissa was the one who cut Octavia off.The ""jokes"" in this movie are objectively unfunny and run off for far too long. One example is a joke near the beginning of the movie between Melissa and some cafe owner who shes friends with and the cafe guy makes a weird error in his speech and he keeps trying to make joke after joke about it but it just comes off so awkward. Not to mention the ""dweebish"" character that is supposedly a victim of Melissas bullying. He purposely fails at comedy but it just doesnt make him any better. The only good gag in this movie we get is when Octavias character gets the easier treatment while Melissa gets the painful treatment. But they cant even get that right because Octavia immediately gets a hold of her powers and thats it.The logic and plot in this movie is frustrating. The villian is PAINFULLY obvious I even got the double crosser on the first try. If you decide to watch the movie I dont even have to spoil it for you because its just that obvious. Also every single person in this movie is hilariously not smart even though there are 2 smart characters in this movie. No one bothers to get decent security to keep Melissa from getting poweres the bad guys miss the good guys even though they could totally just kill them and oh gosh the ending which Ill get to after the next part.My least favorite part of the movie is the raw chicken bit and crab man! Melissa has to fight against a crab man robber and just flirts with him? Also he goes ""you cant kill us that would make you bad!"" as if arrest wasnt an option. But yeah Melissa just uses the seduction technique. Later on they both confess that they like raw chicken and oh gosh thats sort of where the ending ties in!The ending is meh. The villain wants to blow up a building cool but then the two girls just rush in and wowsers they nearly lose until Octavias ""nerdy"" (thanks for that Melissa) daughter suddenly gets super speed and helps! Melissa tosses the villain and the last threat they have is a bomb. The daughter offers to run with the bomb so it doesnt blow up the building but apparently its not ""stable"". Ok? Then Melissa just offers to do it. But one important thing she says before that is ""We cant just throw it out the window itll hurt people!"". Think really carefully then throw your thoughts out the window because they arent needed here. Melissa jumps out the WINDOW with the BOMB. See the problem? Also not to mention there was a large body of water outside of the window the effect wouldve been the same!!! I really thought the ending was bad until...The crab man and Melissa start feeding each other raw chicken mouth to mouth. I think Im not gonna eat crab or chicken for like until I forget this movie exists which should take about a week. Anyways if you thought you wanted to see this movie good for you but I thought the same thing and I was completely wrong.",1.0,3116

Melissa did her best Bateman was entertaining and Pom Klementieff stood out as having the most gusto for her role.

Its rare I cant get all the way through a film but to complete this would have been an exercise in masochism nothing more. The humour was beyond ""not funny"" and out the other side where I felt embarrassed for them. It was almost as though they felt that if they stretched a single awkward scene on for long enough then it would eventually become funny. It doesnt. It just gets more awkward.A waste of some good talent (Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman) on a movie that should never have got past a drunken pitch (nobody sober could have thought this was a good script).Its a shame because if handled well the base premise could have worked.Avoid.",1.0,3136

purelyfortumblr, what's with all the negativity?!,I just watched this and was shocked to see the bad reviews. In my opinion this movie was great! Melissa McCarthy is amazing as always and Octavia Spencer although plays a rather downplayed character is just as amazing. As a lover of marvel and DC films it was so interesting to see older plus sized superheros as well as more POC representation! I loved the story and the characters (apart from crab arms wtf ðŸ˜‚) the comedic timing was brilliant and I would love to see a sequel!

bob-the-movie-man, Getting the crabs is never a laugh.,"Positives:I laughed three times:o Jason Batemans ""Crab-man"" talking about his ironic star-sign;o Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthys love-making scene: the mostinnovative use of butter since ""Last Tango in Paris""!O The duo struggling to get in and out of their Lamborghini supercar: purelybecause it looks just like me these days trying to get in and out of my wifesMazda MX5!Negatives:It singularly fails my ""six laughs"" test for a comedy. The script by Ben Falcone - McCarthys husband - is just eye-rollingly unfunny. The pair must have laughed themselves silly over their own jokes. Its just a shame that their sense of humour diverges so wildly from mine (or indeed anyones?)Melissa McCarthy must be an acquired taste - one Ive never acquired. ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" proves what a class act she can be.... but this does her reputation no good at all.Its criminal to have actors of the quality of Octavia Spencer Jason Bateman and Melissa Leo and use them in such a poor way. Bateman is actually the funniest turn in the piece but thats not saying much.Summary Thoughts on ""Thunderforce"":There are some movies that you just wish had been drowned at birth. This is one. I normally dont regret spending two hours watching a movie but this one felt like wasted time. With ""Twist"" I thought I might have found my worst film of the year. But no theres a new contender in town.(For the full graphical review please check out One Manns Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks).",2.0,3166
tovarishchshevchenko, If you want forced inclusivity...,"Yet another film where all the ""good-guys"" are female and/or black and all the ""bad-guys"" or idiots or just plain dislikables are white and/or male.From the school bully (even though one of the protagonists is also a bully) being a white boy to the heros company only employing women (except for the token black male assistant).Some of my favourite films have very strong heroes who are female or black and they are naturally inclusive - like The Hunger Games: fully inclusive with a female lead in Katniss Everdeen but where everyone - black white male female and disabled - have a role to play and nothing feels forced unlike so many recent films including this.SOme funny moments but they were too far and too few between.",2.0,3167

While bad comedies are not easy to watch you can at least find comfort watching actors having a good time in the silliness of it all. Spencer seems to be suffering from some sort of depression.

Fitzy14, Thunder Force More Like Thunder Thud,Melissa McCarthy is becoming the David Schwimmer (Friends) of actors they are the same character in everything they are in. I wont drag this review out and say how mediocre I think the acting was or how I think Director and writer Ben Falcone should stick to acting. I will simply say if you are looking to shut your brain pan off for an hour and 46 minutes you could do worse that Thunder Force. McCarthy should go back to TV and Octavia please be a bit more selective. There were a few funny lines but overall the usual Melissa McCarthy humor. On a side note I had nachos and the crunching made some of the dialog incoherent so I had that going for me.If you like Melisa McCarthy watch Identity Thief She and Jason Bateman will keep you laughing in that one.,4.0,3201

ludocalvetti, A Disappointment,"Ill admit I went in expecting a terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit banking solely on McCarthys comedic fame to get viewers. The first ten or so minutes seemed to prove me wrong: the child McCarthy and Spencers friendship was cute and I even give the writers props for avoiding the whole ""bully turned into smart kids friend"" trope. Then they quickly age up the characters (which okay I didnt sign up for a teenage story anyway) and they become estranged (fine Ive fought over much stupider stuff with my friends) all with very little humour and none of it stupid. Was the film targeted wrong? Is this a semi serious superhero movie and not a comedy with a superhero veneer?When McCarthy herself finally shows up the film initially keeps the half serious tone and paints a fairly depressing picture of a world where supervillains (albeit petty ones) exist without superheroes to fight them. They kept showing small acts of kindness on McCarthys part which all supported the idea she would make a great hero (a-la Steve Rogers being a hero even without his powers). I even appreciated McCarthys nonsensical dialogue with Kevin Dunns character taking for granted that it wasnt supposed to be ""ha ha"" funny and sounded like rambling in universe as well.Maybe I shouldnt have. Maybe that was supposed to be a laugh out loud bit that simple did not land. Because from the reunion onwards the film decides it clearly does not care about the tone it was setting and becomes just another terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit banking solely on McCarthys comedic fame. It just took some time to pretend it wasnt.What follows is just another superhero spoof with a little heart here and there (Ill admit McCarthy was sweet as Taylor Mosbys sort of aunt) but otherwise nothing to say. It feels more like a collection of unrelated SNL skits held together by spit and the pure comedic power of raw chicken eating. The villains are goofy and not in a good way the plot is as predictable as they come the ""twists"" are as predictable as the plot and overall it looks like Ben Falcone wrote half a script and then didnt bother to re-read it.Which is a shame because the first ten minutes felt like this could be a solid superhero spoof if maybe not a serious superhero movie. In the end I got what I initially expected but I still managed to be disappointed.",4.0,3210

Ben falcone is a talentless HACK who needs to hang up his towel already. MELISSA...please let PAUL FEIG direct your movies like bridesmaids the heat and spy which were all your best films. This thunder buddies movie or whatever the heck its called I really dont care the stupid script bad acting. All of it gave me a dull headache near the front of my forehead.

Dont be misled by the low ratings if you read enough its clear the 1s and 2s have an issue with the body shape of the main characters and/ or perceived ""left wing"" elements. The movie is about as apolitical as it gets. Yeah its not going to be a classic or win any oscars but its a funny and kinda sweet distraction with heart. Some great sight gags and the stunts are pretty good. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8.0,3230
nohats121, Hard to finish,"The only reason to watch this from beginning to end is if you are die hard fans of Melissa and Octavia. The occasional belly-laugh is defused by some really useless silliness. Jason Bateman fans DO NOT WATCH this unless you can immediately binge ""Ozark"" or "" Arrested Development"" when you begin to wish they would hurry and kill his character off.There are some fun moments like when Melissa and Octavia try to enter and exit their sleek superhero car...predictable but still funny. Unfortunately not a good vehicle for either of these two fine actresses. Hope they collaborate again on something more supportive of their talents.",4.0,3231

EpimetheusA1, Thank God I only have to watch that once,"I knew within the first ten minutes that this would be an awful movie and still I continued to watch. Im so glad that I only had to watch that once. I was uncomfortable the entire time-- there were a couple of instances where the jokes landed so well and I thought ""Oh this is a good sign"" but then the next scene the same joke was played out in a different way but worse because we just saw the joke played out five minutes prior. This happened so many times-- too many. McCarthy... you starred in ""The Heat"" and ""Spy""... youre better than this. Nothing but fart and fat jokes-- shamelessly and tastelessly executed. There was no chemistry between Spencer and McCarthy either. Spencer and Bateman youre also better than this but insultingly. I dont know what possessed them to take a role in this farce. I was uncomfortable at first and then I became numb and then I ended up laughing at how horribly fast everything plummeted. Waste of time and resources.

cpclemens, Crab-ola,In fairness to this flick I chose my 3 star rating after having seen only the first 45 minutes. Even if the remaining minutes were somehow a 10 it couldnt bring the average up above a 5 anyway.Much of this cast is great so youd expect a lot from them. Even as a buddy super hero story the concept is new and shouldve been a lot of fun. Instead the jokes are flat the story is too forced to feel like you care about the characters and ultimately just not entertaining.A few moments scattered in the film do come together but theyre few and far between. Ultimately as a whole there just isnt enough to feel like watching was time well spent.,3.0,3260

stuartgoulter," Bag full of nope. Back in the day, this would have been direct to video.",Ben Falcone is a great and funny guy. However his scripts and direction lack critical editing. Im not even half way through this painful movie and I already know how it plays out. And being formulaic isnt the worst part. Its slow. None of the scenes or dialog is tight. The scenes lack rhyme or reason never mind being nuanced or clever. The lame jokes beat you over the head.Melissa and Octavias character development takes way to long for what it provides and you end up not even wanting to like either one once they grow up.Im sorry but if Melissas contract says Ben gets to write and direct x number of films the studio needs to demand ghost directors and writers.Like other efforts with Ben this comes off as half baked and unpolished. This wasnt developed enough to start shooting. There should have been 20 table reads to tune everything up. If there were actual readings no one dared make improvements. Dialog is stiff and there isnt any of the well-timed banter that these actors are known for.So many little things aggravated me because they were just plain lazy.Example:Batemans character should ALWAYS walk sideways not just a couple times.This movie was a disservice to the actors and Falcone. Even Bobby Cannavale doesnt have enough good dialogue to save the scenes hes in.They all have much more talent than was put on film. You could trim 35 minutes and not miss a thing. Im really surprised it got released in this form.This is Ghost Dad levels of power and irresponsiblity.Watched til the end....and regret it. It got worse. Its obvious no one at the studio stepped in - at any point - to fix this.They just wanted to get the obligation off the books. Not a good way to run a successful business or career.,2.0,3265

lusciousmuffins, Why would they do this?,"Why would actors do this to an audience or themselves?McCarthy has made some passable comedies but they have become far too formulaic. She is always the goofy fat lady paired with a infinitely more confident straight-man. The plot all revolve around her magically triumphing because her plucky attitude magically overcomes her physical limitations and gross incompetence. While that trope can be funny once or twice after a while the only thing it generates is cringe not laughter.What I cannot fathom is why so many talented actors and actresses would debase themselves by participating in a film as bad as Thunder Force. Neither money nor friendship with the movies makers should be adequate enticement to involve yourself with such a shockingly bad production.The premise of this film is for lack of a better word dumb. The execution of the thoroughly unoriginal concept is also subpar. Basically Thunder Force is a study in how to waste millions of dollars and alienate fans. There is nothing good about this movie not the dialog not the special effects not acting not the story not even the overarching morality which encompasses pitting the most generic good guys versus bad guys.If McCarthy wants to continue with her career she needs to evolve in some way. She cannot keep roping her friends in Hollywood into making the same movie over and over again changing only the names as she movies from boring comedy to even more boring ""comedy"". Whatever fans she has left after this assault on audiences intelligence are unlikely to be able to suffer through anymore of her recycled brand.",1.0,3303

don-13204, This Movie Should Have Stayed Invisible,Oh Melissa McCarthy you should have stayed on Mike and Molly. Octavia Spencer you should have read the script. After reading the script you should have thrown it away.Thunder Force while it could have been funny about two forty something women gaining superpowers instead turned out to be a lame un-funny Melissa McCarthy vehicle where she is her loud obnoxious stupid character that she has played many times before.Octavia Spencer try as she might to hold this movie together to give it some heart is clearly out of element here. You never see any emotion in her face. Is she upset that McCarthys character comes back into her life. Is she happy? You cant tell. When she had scenes with daughter you just dont care.The writing of this movie was so poor you could tell where it was going from the first five minutes. Under a different director and without McCarthy chewing up each scene she is inthe premise might have worked.But when McCarthy and hubby Ben Falcone get together to make a film funny is not what happens. Dont get me wrong Melissa can be very funny and can show real acting prowess if given a decent script and a director who reigns her in. Falcone on the other hand lets his wife run wild with her facial expressions and low brow attempts to be funny.Suprisingly the funniest lines come from Jason Bateman. If you dare to watch this movie you will see that he has his timing down and is the one bright spot but that is not saying much.And dont get me started on the romantic fantasy scene in the liquor store. It was just weird and out of place.I am giving this movie one star because of the cool looking superhero costumes.

morninmuffin," To be 100% candid, I stopped watching after about an hour...",Nevertheless I would easily rate this as one of the worst films Ive seen in a very long time.Melissa McCarthys brand of humor is generally not my taste but shes undoubtedly funny just not in this terrible super hero money grab of a snore fest.Zero chemistry between she and Octavia Spencer who seemed confused or uncomfortable in the role.I could go on (and on) about just how bad this film was but suffice to say this was a painfully inept unfunny movie with obvious gags stupid hackneyed tropes terrible acting a script written with 10-year-olds in mind and just a really bad film.I left my wife to finish watching this POS and I have no regrets other than leaving her to endure the pain of this complete waste of time and money.Shoutout to Jason Bateman and Bobby Cannavale who should have phoned this in as it would have been just as interesting.Enjoy this paychecks boys because its not as if you earned them.Executive Summary: PU stinkaroo.,1.0,3324

namob-43673, It is not even funny to watch this burn,Some movies are made for ridicule others to laugh at and some like this turd are so awful that you only feel numb.I mean there was a time when Melissa McCarthy was a guarantee for a chuckle while you did shots to her bad dialogue shots to her bad acting and horrible attempts to be funny. Apparently we cannot even have that anymore her movies are getting so bad they are not even c-level.You want to waste your money create a urine soaked dumpster of a movie while people are laughing behind your back? Hire Melissa McCarthy.I know she can be funny I actually enjoyed Spy but something has just gone wrong along the way and I am uncertain if its her own bad taste in scripts or Hollywood just trying to force us this overweight feminist whether she is in good or bad movies.Well one of the leads aside she is not the only thing that stinks around this movie. Octavia is almost as bad and all the side characters and the supposed protagonist are so bad it is not even funny.But of course as with most bad movies it does not stop with bad acting or bad writing or bad casting choices nope it all suck. Light CGi music clothes story every single bit and piece of this movie is so horrible I kept shaking my head and wondering if I have ever seen anything worse.I have by the way seen worse that is. But not many...This is a very strong contender for the worst movie of the year award. I give this a 2/10 because I feel nice and although everything stinks and everything about this movie is awful it is at least consistent and I at least feel like they tried...uhm...I know I know I am just trying to be as positive I can be....Do not see this.

NavyOrion," I tried, I really did","MAYBE this movie suddenly became great in the last half hour. Maybe the effects suddenly became better than what a typical 12-year-old could produce with a laptop and the writing suddenly rose from the bottom of the barrel and became profound and intelligent. It could even be that Melissa McCarthys performance improved to the semi-professional level she showed in ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" or even to the lesser level of ""Bridesmaids"" and Octavia Spencer finally lost the well-deserved look of embarrassment she carried for the first hour or so.Ill never know. Heaven knows I tried to keep a brave face and hope for some improvement (and I bet I watched more of this movie than most people have including the cast of it) but after an hour I just couldnt subject myself to any more. The only reason I watched as long as I did -- the ONLY REASON-- is that it was my turn to pick the movie and I couldnt stand to see the smug look my wife would have when I threw in the towel. As it turns out she was so grateful she never said a word beyond ""Oh thank God"" when I said we had to find something else.Looks like I owe her another viewing of ""Mama Mia."" I can take it.

karamarika," Could have been good, but","The writers couldnt let go of their ridiculous leftist bias to realize they got the details almost right just on the wrong teams. The background story is that the mayor of Chicago is running for re-election (hes the ""Trump"" character) and the ""progressive"" Hispanic woman is moving up in the polls. So this guy gets all the mutants to cause chaos so he has a problem to fix. Think of the mutants (miscreants) as BLM and antifa. Only problem is that they got it all backwards. But that is the MO of the left - accuse your opponent of doing what youre actually doing. If they made the crazy mayor the ""amazing progressive"" and the underdog opponent the grassroots conservative who actually cares about making the city better instead of filling diversity quotas destroying the economy and stoking division then the story would have been true to reality. They certainly took their artistic liberties here.The funniest part of the whole thing is that they accidentally showed that if you work hard you can achieve anything no matter where you came from or what you look like. Whoops that was an unfortunate oversight. Guess the poor silly slobby one just forgot to utilize her ""privilege"" and Spencer just had some magical ability to overcome the ""institutional"" obstacles standing in her way. What a miracle.They should probably work harder to push their agendas next time instead of focusing on things like story character development and dialogue.There were some funny moments. Enjoyed the bit where McCarthy was trying to get Spencer to recognize Urkel and Nell.",3.0,3369

Given the talent in the cast it serves as proof that if theyre working with rubbish theres not a lot their talent can do to salvage it.

Having just watched Bateman in ""This is where I leave you"" this was embarrassing.

lilgtsvee, If you didn't get the humor it was not meant for you,I loved the idea. The whole concept was fun. Two friends. Opposites. Who no matter what care for each other and in a way complete something inside each other. I know Melissas humor often goes over the top but I think in this film it was well balanced. And Octavia is typically a serious actress I thought she did well to bring the film a slightly milder tone. It was full of geek Easter Eggs one of which was a You Killed Kenny line that made my sides hurt.If you didnt get the humor or the story it was simply not meant for you. I enjoyed this film immensely. If this movie had been done with younger thinner actresses I believe the rating would have been higher.

How could Ben Falcone cast an Oscar winner in a poorly made film? Everything from pre-production to post-production was rushed which is unacceptable in Hollywood.

There is a shoehorned-in romance that is more cringe-making than anything and the bad guy is a total joke. The characters are paper thin and acting almost non-existent.

mandyjwebb, What were you thinking?,I have followed Melissas career with interest and found several of her films wildly entertaining especially Spy. However this concoction is so very very disappointing. Firstly the jokes are stretched out way beyond their humour and the chemistry is totally missing between Melissa and Octavias characters. Its as if she signed up to the film before reading the script (cause it had Melissa in it of course why wouldnt you!?) and later regretted the decision but it was too late to say no.This could have been so much better the acting jokes direction and so on. The only person (character) who I felt close to genuine was the actress playing the daughter of Octavias character. She did a fine job in duff circumstances.Only watch if you have nothing better to do. Melissa you are so much better than this!,1.0,3413

michelec-93774, No need to watch this,I gave it a five only for the beginning of the movie. I love both Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. In fact I am shocked Octavia did such a horrible movie. As a person who is not a size zero. I am getting a little upset on how Melissa McCarthy portrays women of size. Its embarrassing. She mostly portrays as uncouth and gross sense of humor. While I dont usually care about swearing she just does it in times its not called for. Even if you werent raised in the best situation her character was around others with manners (for the love of god) pickup so social cures. I did like how the story started out with the girls young. I had hope. Then it just went to gross humor and predictable screw ups. I just wanted this to be good. I was disappointed..,5.0,3443
brainwerx-1, Mildly better than Ghostbusters,Is it a great movie? No.Is it mediocre? If Im being kind...My problem is that with movies like this all the best bits are in the trailer. There are some funny scenes. But overall its a predictable mediocre comedy with no surprises.,5.0,3444
grimm-21014," Wasn't the best, but it was very entertaining!",Im a fan of both Spencer and McCarthy but I never would have thought to put them together and yet it somehow works.Im still not sure what that ridiculous romance plot was in this film and yes the writing couldve been so much better but for something fun to relax and watch with your family it was very enjoyable. I watched it with my parents who are in their sixties and we all laughed through the whole film did we think some of it was stupid? Hell yes! But my god was it a fun movie to escape from this horrible world even for just 106 minutes.We really like this movie and we will be watching it again so if you want a fun escape like we did then why not give it a shot?,10.0,3445

IQ_WINEHUT_MCMXCI, This movie is good,Its not Endgame or Justice League but this is a totally enjoyable movie with a few good laughs throughout. Great cast stupid jokes Miami Vice soundtrack and it reminds me of an old cartoon show. Is it the best movie ever made? No. Is it much better than many modern superhero and comedy movies? Yes yes it is. The only reason I wrote this review was because I felt I needed to come to this movies defence in the wake of a slew of negative reviews trashing the Falcone McCarthy team. I hope they keep making movies together and I hope they make me laugh like this one did.The only critical comment I have is that this would have made a better TV show than a movie but its still worth a watch. Thunder Force!Hope this helped.,10.0,3447

Melissa McCarthy has been the same throughout her acting career if it aint bridesmaid identity Thief Tammy. Spy and heat and now this heap of garbage i do dread what she will be starring in next.I did expect better from Octavia Spencer especially coming from what i personally thought was a brilliant back to back acting career such as Ma Witches Onward and her small role in instant family. But to see her in this type of film its pretty heart breaking as some people would know she can do a lot more better.I know there is a load more extra characters in this movie i aint going to slate them all but i will say this film is definitely a NOT THE ONE TO WATCH!!!!

Jokes go on and on and on and....are not so funny.When is Hollywood going to wake up and realize....good story generally will be rewarded will positive word of mouth and at least good reviews.

khanirawlingsk," Superhero movie, but make it about fat jokes.",Going into this movie I was prepared to love it for a few reasons. I love Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy; I think they are both incredibly talented women for that alone I went in with high expectations and the other reason is that the movie has two plus-size leads and as a plus person myself I am all for that representation especially in a superhero movie as this is almost always never the norm. The twisted thing about expectations however is that they usually lead to disappointment and this movie had bucket loads of it.When Melissa McCarthy is a lead in a movie it would be naÃ¯ve of one not to expect comedy and that is exactly what happened in this movie her character has little to no character development her whole arc in the movie is entirely mad up of being the comic relief like any other movie she is in. This is not Melissas fault because for the most part it works I found myself giggling a few times during the movie I think I was meant to laugh a lot more but most of the jokes fell flat Melissa and Octavia are both plus-size women so the better part of the movie is dedicated to fat stereotypical jokes that compensate for a lackluster storyline.Melissa McCarthy with the help of the young girls that played a younger her(Vivian Falcone and Mia Kaplan) did a decent job bringing a typical Melissa McCarthy character Lydia to life. The really isnt much to dissect about her character she plays out how youd expect her to play out from the moment she is introduced. Melissa McCarthy might just be the most typecast actress in Hollywood but that is a discussion for another time.The storyline was promising a young smart black girl who had a bad thing happen to her as a child growing up to be a powerful woman dedicated to fighting back against those that wronged her as a child is an inspiring story and Octavia Spencer and the young actresses that played a younger her(Bria Danielle and Tai Leshaun) did an amazing job breathing life into the character of Emily Stanton but somehow the storyline still fell flat and this was mostly due to the fact that the movie is too self-aware it is very aware of the diverse cast it has the inclusivity feeling the viewer will get while watching unfortunately it is also because of that self-awareness that they didnt take time to develop their characters make you care about the heroes even the villain.The Crab had more character development than both our heroes and his whole deal is that he has crabs for arms when the only character that is memorable from your movie is a guy whose power is having crab arms then you know your movie did something wrong. This movie had moments where it felt like they wanted you to take a moment serious but then ruined it with a lazy dry joke in the next scene. This movie is bad as far as superhero movies go but its a decent watch if your thing is laughing over forced stereotypical jokes.,2.0,3467
malcolmwrites, Soft Pass,An amusing idea and a great cast cant compensate for poor writing tedious pacing a plodding and predictable plot sloppy editing and a tragic uncertainty about direction or tone. This film couldve been the next Sky High The Mask Super Mystery Men or even Deadpool. Unfortunately thanks to what feels like a rush-job with some actor-director nepotism thrown in its not even Shazam. Ill give it a 6 for originality and potential and a 4 for execution. Thats about a 5. And Ill take away a point for wasting the talents of Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. (And for wasting Pom Klementieff who should spend the rest of her life playing Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy where she positively scintillates!) So 4 / 4.5 out of 10 feels about right. Youre better off just reading the summary and hearing about this movie from friends. Otherwise its probably a soft pass.,4.0,3468

michael-561-692892, Not worth the time commitment,"McCarthy has funny films that have a typical formula that make them funny usually starting with a script written by people who get the comedy genre and then a director paired with an editor that understand timing and delivery. This film doesnt have that formula. The reviews that say 10/10 should be required to answer a real ""why"" question in order to be visible by others.My ""why"" for a 2/10: falls flat on many scenes that could have been funny if the right lead was cast. McCarthy as a dumb but strong character paired with a woman that seems to lack any and all comic ability definitely delivers as is. That is- it doesnt. Spencer is a great actress. We have seen her delivery in dramas. It makes no sense in this case when really all we needed as a humorous lead allowing McCarthy to be the comic relief shes good at as a supporting character or one that can be trashed and get laughs.A quick search for ""Spy"" is a good resume for McCarthys success. Or even brides maids. Both roles she acted as a side kick to someone even more ridiculous than here. Spencer doesnt do it.",2.0,3473

mdubya-71216, Made Mid-Pandemic and It Shows...,"Im not sure exactly when they began filming this movie but its quite evident that this was made during the Covid era which at least explains some of its downfall. During the first third of the movie characters are seen standing 10 feet apart from each other for entire scenes including a reunion moment when the main characters are supposed to be seeing each other for the first time in 20 years. Lack of physical interaction / touching is also pretty noticable. I can commend the cast and crew for trying to get work done in the midst of a pandemic but unfortunately the script itself is ultra lacking.The characters are one dimensional and two of the main villains have a severe lack of motive and seem to both just have an inexplicable fetish for ""killing people."" What an innovative concept for a baddie. Meanwhile Michelle McCarthy is using super strength to fight off bad guys while Octavia Spencer turns invisible and hides...she does almost nothing the entire movie. Neither does Jason Bateman whom I love but whose super power is...crab arms? And he participates in fights by literally...clipping his claws and sideways crab-walking away? And he somehow used this talent to make it into the elite inner circle of the bad guys?Aside from a few laughable moments most of the script and comedy was gimmicky and predictable. I felt like I was reading the first draft of a script (which again maybe was because it was all they could do to get content made during COVID but unfortunately...its a bit of a fail.)

graham-575," Nothing ""worked""","The story was bizarre which doesnt help to get a comedy movie off the ground. ""Spy"" was so much better for McCarthy. This one just reached too far for humour and seemed to fail at every hurdle. I didnt even watch the end of it. The script was bad and you just got the feeling like the actors were struggling with the whole idea of it.",4.0,3503
ebbzillasenpai, A cliche filled mess,"The story is remarkably simple and filled with cliches everywhere. They do try to create a whole new sort of universe where people got ""superpowers"" but the beginning when they explain how it started is where the universe begins and ends. It is boring predictable and just an all out ""cringe-fest"" to watch. It had some clever jokes but I could count them all on one hand.It is a movie build up on cliches a boring plot and midcore actors (except Octavia Spencer and some side actors). You could almost feel their uninterest through the screen as they played out their characters. I would not say I hated the movie more so that I did not enjoy watching it and found myself picking up my phone or looking at the time as it was playing out on the screen.Overall it is not great and could be better.",4.0,3504
bjayarajah, Stuck in the middle,I can see what this movie is attempting to do however it doesnt hit the spot. Its neither satire enough to be a spoof nor serious enough to pass as an action movie. For that reason it simply sits in the middle and drags with the occasional funny line. Had they pushed it further on the spoof side it could have been fantastic. Poor writing was the death of this movie.,3.0,3505

strindbergman, Barely funny,There are funny movies (Bridesmaid) there are movies that are not funny (Fruitvale Station The Help). There are movies that you think they would be funny and then theyre not (Identity Thief) there are movies that you dont think theyd be funny and then they are (Spy The Heat Ghostbusters). And then there are the movies that you dont think theyd be funny but because youve been there and eventually found them funny you end up watching it and then you find it is not funny at all. Thunder Force belongs to the latter one.Spencer and McCarthy dont have chemistry as soromance/BFF the acting direction does not exist in this movie the story is kind of lame and weak powerless. The directing is as standard as any mid-budget fantastic flick with the same shots the same camera movements the same editing the same CGIs the same whatever.I honestly thought that most of the people would be wrong about the negative reviews but after watching Thunder Force all I can say is that dont waste a couple of hours of your time by watching this flawed comedy.,4.0,3510

cgvsluis," Will you be my...beginning, my middle, my end?","What a beautiful song to conclude this sweet series adapted from the YA novels by Jenny Han ""To All The Boys Ive Loved Before"". While not as strong as the first movie this third and final film in the trilogy was better than the second film. There were some great Seoul travel shots and some wonderful shots of New York City...but ultimately this was the final entry in Peter and Lara Jeans romantic love story that started with a bunch of love letters and a fake relationship...and is concluded in this film which starts with The Covey (Lara Jeans) Family in Seoul Korea for spring break. The big highlights in the film are the senior trip to New York finding out about college acceptance the prom Dr. Coveys wedding and graduation. This film is like a post card for high school romance and doesnt delve too deep into any heavy topics although they do make an attempt to heal Peters relationship with his father and touch on the Covey family grief in regards to their mom.Sweet good hearted escapism and perfect Valentines tribute!",6.0,3516
Anne-0016, Copy/Paste Plot,Im annoyed that it was the EXACT same plot as the last two-super cute in the beginning a break up in the middle and then a super cute make up at the end. Just substitute NYU for John Ambrose and you got the same movie.I gave it a 6 because like the other two the cinematography costume design music and actors were so damn likeable! Although I would expect a Hollywood hair stylist to figure out extensions by now-the hair was driving me crazy.Overall I REALLY wanted to like this but it just felt like I was rewatching the same movie over and over.,6.0,3517
ktweitzman, Felt different than the first two,It didnt have the charm of the first and even felt very different than the second. The idea of Peter dragging Lara Jean about NYU and making her feel guilty is very out of character a change from the book that makes a series about love and hope feel very.... Toxic. I think small changes are fine but that one make this movie much more painful than necessary and not a great message. Missed opportunity! Make Peter more vulnerable! Make Lara Jean work on expectations! So much room for positive character growth!,6.0,3518
grgiadsmith, A pleasant ending to a charming series,"After the disappointment of the second movie ""p.s I still love you"" I definitely had low expectations going into the final instalment of the series yet I was gladly surprised by how much I enjoyed the film . Although not being anything particularly redefining in the romance genre with a notably substandard plot  I couldnt help but be charmed by the atmosphere of the movie and the chemistry between Lana Condor and Noah Centineo the latter generally surprising me since I had preferred the relationship between Lara Jean and her other love interest John Ambrose in the previous movie far more than hers and Peters. So even though the movie was nothing remarkable it still remained a feel good movie for anyone to enjoy and ended the series on a high note.",5.0,3519
Pinebutt, Meh,"So... it had soooo many things to point out.1. It didnt follow much of the book.2. They took out ALOT of scenes that could have helped the plot such as the beach scene.3. Why make Kavinsky so insecure for no outcome? Or for them to just make up like typical children that are supposed to be developing into adults?4. Why not add an additional scene such as visiting Berkeley? Especially if you are going to change up the the plot of the series?5. What was the point to the Dae and Kitty romance?6. Tris actor made no sense to the character and was severely underwhelming.7. If you cant make hair extensions work then get a damn wig. Her hair was terrible for the entire movie.8. Why wouldnt Josh have been invited to the wedding? Or any characters that had a build?9. She looked boring at prom in comparison to a old seniors home dance from the second.10. No where near as good as the first and worse than the second which was only ""okay""Basically this movie was... lacking. It got a 3 because of its continuation of series and typical high school romcom which is my guilty pleasure at the age of 32. Otherwise i likely wont be in a hurry to rewatch this.",3.0,3520

michelleeichu, Boring and non existent plot,So I loved the first movieit was a cute teen rom com as its supposed to be.The second one was a downgrade from the first but still had some good points and was actually entertaining and had some tension.This one well was simply terrible. There is nothing that happens in the movie that warrants to be told. I havent read the books so I dont know what happens in it but this definitely felt absolutely unnecessary. Just wasted 2 hours of my life. So unproductive lags on without anything actually happening.Do not waste your time on this.,5.0,3522
bincysara-60188, Terrible,Whoever is giving 10 is definitely a teenager because it would look more acceptable in their eyes. To anyone 22 above this is a dragging romcom you just want to skip to the end . Seriously deciding which college for two hours sounds to me like first world problems!! Similar to kissing booth 2 equally bad ! What a joke! Avoid !,2.0,3523

ritikasanthosh, Not the first and not the second,I guarantee its not like the second movie that made you want to gauge your eyes out. This movie did provide a beautiful ending but there was something about it that I felt it was missing.I kinda wished they did a little more with it its almost liked they played it safe this time. Not necessarily a bad thing but there are many ways they couldve done so much more.I do recommend watching it it will absolutely exceed your expectations if you were thinking it would be like the second.Give it a go watch it. It wont be a waste or your time for sure!,7.0,3525
hilly-97876, take it for what it is: a really cute movie,Everyone who watches this movie knows what theyre getting: a coming of age movie full of sweet moments. So if thats your thing: go watch it and enjoy it! If its not: why are you even watching this?This movie was adorable and it felt like the right way to say goodbye to Lara Jean 10/10!,9.0,3526
Zaid_Khoury, Expect the unexpected,I write this by saying I thought the movie had a lot of cute moments you watch this to have a virtual hug on your heart this wont win any Oscars but you watch this for a good time and to end with a smile.A lot of people are giving this a 1/10 star for some reason maybe for how it ended but I liked how it ended didnt follow the trend that college needs to end things.Nice trilogy liked these movies Lara and Noah played the parts beautifully focus on the positive guys and just have a good time.,8.0,3527
katrinaysabelr, A good end to a Friday night,Always and Forever was another To All the Boys adaptation that ended on a lighthearted note. The plot stayed somewhat loyal to the book which I appreciate and as usual the cinematography was really nice-it had the ability to make you wanna just curl up on your sofa with some hot cocoa.Sentimentality aside this definitely wasnt a perfect movie. Dont expect Oscar-worthy acting or a mind-blowing plot. Its simplicity and sophistication made this conclusion satisfying but at the same time leaves you with that feeling that youre definitely going to miss it.A bit on the cliché side but it was just what I needed.,8.0,3528
criticspider, A decent conclusion with a few sloppy moments,Delivers a decent conclusion to the franchise. Story is too simple like the previous outings had a few draggy moments here and there could have used a few trims and shortened the movie by 15 min but nevertheless it had decent duration compared to most rom-coms. If you watched the previous installments youll most probably watch it for the closure which this movie delivers more or less.,6.0,3529
jordyntsmith, Actually Okay,For context I am a 28-year-old male who has never seen the previous movies. (My wife wanted to watch it for Valentines Day). I am not the target demographic but I did enjoy the movie.The acting is good the writing is actually good and the cinematography is surprisingly excellent! Its a little too sweet overall but it is a fairly easy film to watch.Its nothing over-the-top but the movies does not do anything wrong in my opinion.,7.0,3530
guglemyphone-12626, A solid ending to this movie trilogy,An average and typical american high school love story with an interesting and likeable teenage girl as the main character and her also interesting family. A solid ending to this movie trilogy. The rating refers to the overall impression.,7.0,3531
sherinsyril, Not bad! Not bad at all!,I thought this movie would be boring like the second one but im glad it was not that bad.There are certain scenes that may make you think about certain aspects of life which makes this movie kinda interesting.Im glad Lara Jean chose what she wanted instead of being clingy and codependent. Was a little annoyed with Kavinsky tho like boy can you be a little more supportive? But at the end youll kinda understand him too.And yesss we finally got to see Chris and Trevors cute relationship.All the characters had some storyline and screentime and Im thankful for it lol.Altogether a good watch :),8.0,3532

notmoviemasterreviewer, Absolutely Loved It,I did not know what to expect from this movie but what I got was a million times better.Peter Kavinsky really redeemed himself in this movie. In TATBILB 2 I was not his biggest fan -- he seemed so childish compared to mature Lara Jean but in this movie I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM TOGETHER.The growth of the characters is just chefs kiss. This movie put some focus on some of the side characters as well but instead of it being cluttered and all over the place everything flows so nicely together!I am a sappy person and I will cry at anything and everything that I think is beautiful and I found myself crying about 4 or 5 times during the movie. And when I was not crying I would be stupid smiling. It is such a feel good film.The cinematography was gorgeous the acting brilliant the storyline relatable and it rounded off so well. Definitely worth the watch.,10.0,3534
nchareonsup, LOVED IT.,"There are SO many reasons why I LOVE this movie series. But let me just begin my listing my top 3:#1 ASIAN Female lead who is actually NOT stereotyped is outspoken and has a mind of her own while also being so freaking cute stylish and quirky in so many different ways.#2 Biracial relationships different cultures and diversity throughout the cast and films.#3 Lara Jean and Peter Kavinksy...need I say more?!?!Alright Ill admit...I am a sucker for rom coms...but it really is awesome to see a boss lady like Lana Condor representing the asian american woman in Hollywood.Get em!P.S. these films will ""always and be forever"" be in my faves (see what I did there?)",8.0,3535
jerricastanley, Worst of the series,I knew that some of the details from the book would have change due to the location of the story. The book takes place in Virginia. The movie is set in Oregon. But I didnt expect some of the major conflicts and characters to be missing. Im not going to give any spoilers but some things were watered down and some things were added that just dont make sense. This one missed the mark for me.,6.0,3536

maiengel-83071, Worse than the second film!,The second movie irrevocably ruined the first one for me will not be able to watch it again.Peter is even more selfish and self-obsessed than before. Just because he got accepted to a certain college he now expects LJ to follow him like a puppy dog. It never once occurs to him that he could transfer to her top choice as well?? When LJ doesnt do what he wants her to do he feels abandoned and basically compares her to his father who left him.The ending seemed forced and patched up. Peter is selfish and immature what a joke! Might as well go back to Gen if shes closer.,4.0,3539
L-dems, Awful.,If I could give zero stars I would. This movie was worse than your typical high school romance movies. I am a woman in my thirties and am unashamed to say that I like watching these high school rom-coms because it reminds me how much Ive grown. I kept watching this movie only because I wanted to finish the series. It was definatly the worst film of the series. Things I am glad I never did in high school: 1) have a high school boyfriend- your brain isnt even equipped to deal with all the actual relationship drama let alone actual problems. 2) let a boy determine where I want to go to school let alone feel indepted to that boy- the entire plot was her feeling bad that she wasnt going where he was. 3) fall in love in high school- it never lasts get your crap together and find someone like minded this movie gives and unrealistic veiw of romance and must have been written by a teenager.When you have lived a little and experience REAL relationships you understand stuff like this is garbage. Its not cute. Its boarder line controling. And WHRRE THE HECK ARE THE PARENTS. Geez. 2 hours I will never get back.,1.0,3540
elliemccaig-71898, not worth the watch,What tries to imitate an early 2000s teen rom-com ends up being a seriously cringeworthy downgrade from the first movie only slightly better than the second. The slow motion montages enhance the cliched nature of the film making it almost unbearable.,4.0,3541
melodyso, had to fast forward most of it,Starting with the positive I like how they use Gee at the beginning and the diversity of the cast is worth praising. Also the color tone of the movie is very pleasing.But thats it. The rest of it is annoying. They are being so dramatic over the college thing. Two hours of Larajean hopelessly devoted to Peter and having an emotional rollercoaster at her room. And Peter acting all cool and effortlessly popular. Its honestly very have to relate to them and care for the storyline. And as everyone has said thats no plot. Its just a bunch of montage without real happenings that push the story progression or character growth.And can we talk about how Peter SUDDENLY changed his mind and prepare this surprise and Larajean SUDDENLY felt okay about everything again? Its basically the ending of the 2nd movie too. Its too cheesy and hard to watch...,4.0,3542
stevebutler-05126, Had to stop watching...so boring,I tried to watch it because it was new on Netflix and I like to give the new stuff a chance. Unfortunately I had to stop watching it after 45 minutes because nothing interesting had happened and I was certain that nothing interesting was ever going to happen.The only good thing about this movie was the scene in the cartoon style cafe. It made me want to visit that cafe. You see the problem here? I was more interested in the filming locations than the actors and dialogue. Thats how boring it is!Unless you have no paint to watch drying I would give this one a wide berth.,2.0,3543
berrydrops, fantasy in la la land,A complete bore and utter waste of time. whats the point of this third sequel? happily ever after exist and prince charming will come saving your from whatever misery. i did not just spend 2/3 of the movie watching lara jean decide on which uni to enrol in. the movie didnt ever go as far as to take us to life in the university where conflicts could possibly unravel. it literally stopped at a bloody university choice with a petty fight ensuing after with a i will always love you closure. lazy production. a first grader could have possibly came up with this storyline. tbh i enjoyed the first sequel bc we could empathise and relate to lara jean and her embarrassment. but the other sequels are just starting to make me believe that lara jean a conceited mawkish champ who needs to be snapped out of her fantasy. and need i add: theres nothing special about lara jean to gawked at or be captivated by. this whole fairytale set up with disgustingly sugarcoated.,1.0,3544

vincentlynch-moonoi, If I didn't know one of the actors...,"The first question I need to personally answer is: Why is a 71 year old man watching and reviewing this Neflix flick? There is a reason -- one of the supporting actors was a student in the middle school where I was (at the time) the vice principal -- and that is Ross Butler. I think hes a talented not-as-young-as-he-looks actor who isnt getting enough good parts although he did VERY nicely in ""Thirteen Reasons Why"". I wish him great luck in his career.As to this film...well it certainly is aimed at the teen crowd. And thats okay. I will tell you this...three ""chapters"" of this is enough. The plot here is...well not thin but one-minded: will the high school lovers have a life together beyond high school. At first its yes. Then its no. And finally its maybe. And I have to admit that the final answer is done nicely if what you want is a happy ending thats not necessarily very realistic.Youre not going to be on the edge of your seat watching this. Its fairly predictable. But I do have to give kudos to Lana Condor who plays the lead high school character. I think shes a good actress. Im not as impressed with Noah Centineo the lead male here. Ive seen him in a couple of Netflix movies and...well I just dont get the attraction. Anna Cathcart as the younger sister has potential. Everyone else...well they look young and adequate.The first installment of this series of three movies was the best. I really cant recommend this one.",6.0,3547

Jackieeeee93, The best of the 3 movies!,The first movie was my favorite but this one was better! Very cute movie with a touching ending. The perfect closure for the story.

erlelmlauknes, It's a no for me,I am terribly sorry to say this but it was truly painful to sit through this movie.

I did somewhat like the first movie and the second one was mediocre however some movies really does not need sequels at all at least not TWO...,2.0,3550
lesless, It was fine,For me the whole movie felt like it should have been a 20 minute introduction to the actual movie where they go to college and we see how long-distance works out for them.

Sonnenblume63, Dull and sexist,Im probably far too old to enjoy teenage movies but I loved the first To All the Boys so had hoped for this third instalment to provide light but a bit different relief during lockdown. Well I was wrong.There was nothing joyful or quirky about this film. 2 hours of immature back and forth are we really to believe teenagers still behave like this? And do we really want to sell young women this pretty rose tinted idea of romance?Peter at no point offered to change college after year 1 to be closer to LJ putting the onus on LJ to make their relationship work and quite frankly gave the whole story a pretty misogynistic vibes. And thats ignoring everything (aka the hottub scene) that happened in the second film. I missed John Ambroses character given how much more mature he was and how he treated LJ as an equal.On reflection they should have stopped after the first film.,4.0,3553
lkswiss, Should have stopped at 2,Quite the fan of the first however perhaps they should have left it with the second sequel. Lost its touch. Found it a time waster.,2.0,3554
DR_ADAWG, Boring Hot Garbage,Almost 2 hours of excruciating melodrama. Terrible dialogue. Loved the first move but none of the feeling or joy translated to this hunk of junk. The story was so full of filler it could have been abbreviated to 30 minutes. A pain to sit through.,2.0,3555
katerates, At least it was better than the second movie ...that was a disaster,The first one was hands down the best was not cringey and did not make me think it was cliche like most Netflix movies. Second was awful and undid everything the first did was way too fast for any of her romances and just made her seem dumb. Now the third movie it was better than I expected but I felt like it was sort of unresolved. He gets all upset because you want to attend a university that fits you? Sounds like a major red flag to me. Then he doesnt even want to give it a try but somehow makes it seem like hes madly in love with you and wins you back so easily? I dont know I found some parts cringe but it did a better job than the second. I think 5/10 is being pretty generous. I do like that LJ was consistent on who was her friend etc and not erasing what had been done. I also liked how they brought back the Lauv song. I wished we got some context as to what happened to Josh her childhood best friend from the first movie... like what he was her neighbour too. I also want to know where John Ambrose is. It just feels like they brush off characters so easily. Oh whoever was in charge of the costumes did an awful job. Dressed LJ like a toddler in some scenes and her prom dress was awful!,5.0,3556

JonathanTch, Good lord,"Look I know were not watching an academy award performance here its just a rom-com. But good lord to quote Penquinz0 ""I felt like I was stuck in a hyperbolic time changer during the entire movie."" To me the plot felt very ""oh god I didnt get into the college I want but now I did what do I do??"" yada yada yada... It felt very first world problems. The plot felt incredibly boring: first you plan for college dont get in be sad get into another one be happy have to choose be sad then everyone makes up in the end to be happy. I did appreciate some of the acting during some of the more ""sad"" scenes but all of the happy/montage/joke moments came off as super unauthentic and very predictable. I swear I could feel a vein popping out of my cranium when I had to hear another ""joke"" that was entirely predictable by some previous scene like the film is nudging at you ""Hey hey did ya catch that? Get it??"" Did I mention this movie felt like it had a 5 hour time span too?",2.0,3558
joey357-282-301486, The end of this movie...,This trilogy has been a fun cute high school rom com. The third installment is the lesser of the three. The scene that stuck out the most surprisingly is in the diner with Peter and his dad. It was simple yet moving. This may not be appropriate in terms of reviewing a movie but I just gotta say the movie is not a happy ending. Their not gonna make it. Coast to coast formidable years completely separate been dating for less than a year and afterwards what? Is Peter gonna move to NY play catch up with their relationship and find a job? If its true to the books then there you go but I dont see it. This is also fiction so I guess it doesnt matter. My point is that the ending is saying happily ever after but I am not convinced it is.,6.0,3559
caljusray, A heartwarming end to the trilogy,A film that definitely gives u a warm hug in these troubling times. Way better than the last film but the first one was war more superior. Accompanied by great soundtrack and amazing visuals throughout the 2 hours. Cinematrogrophy was so good especially in Korea and New York. It really captured the beauty of both cities. Kudos to the leading actor and actress for giving such a charismatic and powerful performance on the screen. A number of tear-jerking scenes and a couple of scenes that will make you laugh. The ending was not perfect but a fulfilling and satisfying one.,9.0,3560

Chemistry between the cast has always been there. I feel like it could have been longer though with the breakup dragged out longer but I assume it closely follows the books which I havent read.For anyone who has had a high school romance and had to go through the ups and downs this is like a trip down memory lane.

mikayakatnt, Many unsolved issues,"It can be hard to end a trilogy. To All the Boys: Always and Forever tries it and flops.Though the film is easy to enjoy when watching it fails once one scratches beneath the surface.Also whats with romcoms that have relationships with red flags?LDRs are not easy and this movie ends up setting both main characters for failure. Peter (Noah Centineo) shows that he is not ready for the commitment of an LDR. Lara Jean (Lana Condor) ends up being a passive character willing to give up everything for him. She basically goes to a school that is not her first choice to save the relationship.And getting back together was a cheesy way to wrap things up. Its predictable and leads to no character development throughout the story. No growth at all. What message does this send to its viewers?Also ""were not like the other couples."" No. They stage 1 of a failed LDR. Theyre one of many HS-to-college relationships that fail within the first year.At least the cinematography of NYC and Seoul looked really cool. +1 star for that.1.5/5.",3.0,3567
dthokchom-13962, Good but could have been better,It was good but it could have been better..the plot was somewhat sloppy..The movie is about trying to connect the old school romance and changes along with digitalisation.,6.0,3568
tanaytamhankar, Loved !,So I am a big fan of American teenage romances. They are unrealistic however they are glamorous and feel good. They show you the school life which folks like me in India only dream of. No uniform  kissing in school high school jocks popular mean cheerleaders and always getting admissions in Stanford  Berkeley or the ivy leagues. This one was really sweet. I thoroughly enjoyed the mixed race lead played by Lana. Her acting was perfect. Noah overacted a bit with unnecessary brow raises and head tilts but was watchable. The sisters were good and dad was the best. Its one of those series which you always want more and more sequels cause they have a feel good factor. Fortunately the relationship wasnt shown to be toxic and forceful like the After series and Kissing booth. They are enjoyable and colourful. There is great chemistry between the lead actors. I personally wish that they do more movies together. Noah however needs to up himself in the acting game.,10.0,3569
evabeyerpaulsen, There's literally no plot,The only good thing about this film is the aestethic interior and clothing choice. Although sometimes its also too much. The film is filled with untied ends. Theres absolutely no plot and somehow its even worse than the two previous ones. I hate this movie and I cant imagine I spent two hours watching this nonsense. The two protagonists are impossible to like theyre toxic and they have no chemistry. The whole cast is awful and the characters have no traits other than their love for each other and their family issues. They have awful personalities and the whole plot is just non-existing. Total waste of time you cant even watch it as a guilty pleasure with a bucket of Ben&Jerrys. Id rather watch Twilight then.,2.0,3570
DrewDeLand, A great ending,This movie ends the trilogy really well. I loved the first film and I thought the second film was just okay so I was skeptical that the third one would disappoint me but I am happy to report that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I wont spoil anything but I am happy with what Barbara Jean chooses.,8.0,3571
zoesfeir, So predictable,It s about the two characters LJ and peter graduating from high school and going to college and here began to have problems that are separating the two of them and in the end they do the long distance relationship and make up. I didnt t like this movie like the firstone and it was so predictable and it was disappointing.,6.0,3572
saman_aizaz, Nowhere near as good as the first,Was excited to watch this but was let down as it was no where near as good as the first. Felt like a super cheesy pre-teen forced romance. There was no sign of the spark that Lana and Noah shared in the first part which had made this such a hit. Please dont have another pet and ruin TATBILB even more,5.0,3573
jasonmelbornesphys, It's fine.,It was an okay movie. Ive read the books and I think their better. The movie probably wouldve been better if some of the other things/aspects in the book were incorporated into the movie. But for now its just a meh. Neither the best and neither the worst.,5.0,3574
debbiebertelhe, Annoying and farfetched,The plotline is completely farfetched at this point and IMO this shouldve been one film not a trilogy. This time it tried to get into some real topics on family relationships and coming of age life decisions but the focus on the main characters relationship status is beyond annoying. It still shows a good effort on representation though.,5.0,3575
katiequeenoftennessee, Pretty boring,"I dont understand the screenwriting for any of these movies. I think they realized that Gen Z loves daydreamy and romantic montages on tiktok so they decided to put random ones in this movies that are completely unnecessary and dont further the plotline at all. The montage of them traveling and being cute/existing in New York was sooo long. It didnt add anything of value to the movie. I thought this during most scenes.I know that they filmed this movie a while ago. Netflix must have been excited to capitalize on the success of the first movie and filmed the sequels as fast as possible.The closing scene where Lara Jeans dad gets married to Trina and ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" is actually somewhat enjoyable but thats really the only scene. Also why did we need three versions of the Beginning Middle End song? Why??Again great trailer. Really made me think that the movie was going to be watchable. Who edits the trailers anyway? Theyre wonderful. Why are the trailers so good? Its always such a big letdown. At least its over now.",3.0,3576
evagreen-106," Meh, worse than the second one",I loved the first movie Lara Jean and Peter were so cute together but the second movie ruined the most important scene from the first one.Im not sure why people saying Peter wants to force her to go to Stanford too. Obviously everyone would want their SO to go to the same school and its okay to be disappointed about it.The third movie the plot could have been more interesting but it felt like it was desperately trying to be cool and fresh and edgy but it was a meh I actually just skipped a few scenes. Although Im older so I guess it will appeal to the younger audience.This movie is okay to watch on a Sunday afternoon it will sure make you feel good but its nothing extra.I wish they stopped after the first one.,4.0,3577

niapineda, It's an ok ending to the adaption.,"Its a cutesy-visual heavy movie. It relied a lot more on ""for the gram"" scenery than the storyline because the beginning was meh the middle was mediocre and the ending was ok. You can tell that there were changes in screenwriting and music which is what made the first movie the best one. (The 2nd one can be skipped altogether) If you read the books youre in for an entirely different story. We watch this entirely for the chemistry between Lana & Noah.",7.0,3582

safirahu," ""To All the Boys: Never Again""","I feel like the 3rd movie in a franchise (apart from Harry Potter and Avengers of course) is always so slow and feels like a filler for the unfortunate sequel to come.Lara Jean and Noah plan to spend their college years together and this final year of high school is literally Lara deciding whether or not Berkley is the one for her .... and then you have other insignificant subplots like Chrissy and her on/off boyfriend Laras Dad remarrying and Peter and his birth dad reconnecting (sort of).The dialogue and character interaction was kinda dry compared to the last two movies - Noahs character was basically put on auto pilot. I mean where was his cute and funny charm from the first film? Did someone he love die in between the 2nd and 3rd film? Character relationships didnt seem to be going anywhere and it was like watching paint dry -- no development whatsoever. Peter and Laras relationship development never got anywhere just like pushing jelly up a hill.The main thing I disliked was making out like losing your virginity at 17/18 is the most important thing a boy and girl should do before they graduate high school. Having sex in order to commemorate a relationship and make the bond stronger is utter bull-faeces. The idea of the couple in this franchise was supposed to be cheesy like the 80s movies they reference a lot -- adding those few shots which insinuated the sex lost that recurring theme.Moreover the film was unnecessarily long. I feel like they coulda cut all the silly montages such as the NY trip because really a citys environment shouldnt be the ONLY reason one moves to a college in said city. Very random for her to just choose NYC just because she met a few ""cool"" hipsters and helped carry a sofa from a party onto the New York subway. Good music but it barely carried the scenes. And finally I get that kids use their phones A LOT in 2021 but enough of the weird phone screen views - theres just too much exposition.Overall the ""should I choose college or Peter"" plot was longed out and coulda easily been done in 20mins.",4.0,3586
davidadesegun," 2,942 miles","LJ and Peter throughout this movie navigates the struggle that comes with a life altering decision. Their romantic lives are turned upside down when LJs application is turned down. Throughout the almost 2 hour runtime we see the the pair trying and failing to weave each other into their futures before ultimately coming to terms with the reality of the situation.These movies have always been about more than just the pairs romantic relationship which is quite refreshing. As we see LJ also balance her home life and the challenges that come from new and exciting developments. This allows LJ to be more than just Peters girlfriend. She has agency and its been fulfilling seeing her come into her own.A personal gripe I have is the ""always and forever"" conclusion and the arrogant attitude of how their relationship will survive because ""they arent like other couples.""Ultimately the movies biggest weakness comes from its nearly 2 hour runtime. The characters have almost nothing to do but the biggest strength of the teenage romance genre is the romance and the pairs chemistry makes it ALMOST worthwhile.",5.0,3587

kaseyw729, Where was this when I was 17?!,This is such a cute series! The low ratings are just plain ignorance & can only be angry people. These movies did such a great job aligning with the books the acting is adorable and the story lines are so cute & great. I mean Im 29 now and I was almost on the verge of tears at one point just because it was too cute. At 17/18 these moments are exactly how this movie makes them feel. Who can imagine leaving the love of their life at the time for a school so far away just when it seems things are so great?? Yes it seems corny at times but its cute its supposed to be that way theyre acting as a17 year old would at that time. These movies are cute & perfect. Must watch for sure!,8.0,3589

queenthingzz, I just loved it,Weve reached the final chapter of LJ + PKs love story but in the bottom of my heart theres a silent voice screaming for more.Admit it or not To All The Boys: Always and Forever is just a simple romance film about a couple holding on the fear of LDR relationship failure however the way how they explored that simple story is very impressive. They take a vast scope to explore the story: a story about dreams and how this dreams affect their relationship.Pros and ConsWe are on the final chapter but the feel-good aura we felt since the first installment was still there as well as the comedic charm of the lead actress. To All The Boys: Always and Forever served a countless praise worthy elements that makes the film more immersive and fascinating to watch. First likable characters. Every character knew how to react on certain things without the need of being exaggerated and forceful just to make the scene interesting. Second healthy relationship. LJ and PKs relationship isnt your cheesy type of couple who always going below the belt. They both knew how to build each other up.Aside from those remarks To All The Boys: Always and Forever has a aesthetic and fascinating visuals. From the hand-drawn settings in Korea to the colorful Lara Jeans room makes the viewing experience more eye-catching.Weve reached the final chapter but their love story that started from love letters to real life couple will remain memorable. Always and Forever.,8.0,3592

markusshahn," Why name it like a great book, if it has nothing to do with it?",Without Remorse is probably my favorite Tom Clancy book - imagine my excitement when I see its been turned into a movie and then my utter disappointment after realizing that the only thing this movie has in common with the book are the title and the names of a few characters.To add insult to injury what follows is a bland storyline with at times nonsensical situations.,2.0,3594
rikakiah-68522, Either make a Clancy movie or don't,As a generic soldier/spy movie this isnt horrible. Id give it maybe a 6--dont expect much but it has entertaining moments. As a Tom Clancy movie based on a book with established characters and canon a 1 isnt a low enough rating. It has nothing to do with the book and little to do with the Clancy universe beyond a couple of names. Its nothing more than a cheap cash grab using the Clancy name. People need to either come up with original IPs or at least attempt to stick a little closer to the namesake material.,1.0,3595
demoxpert, Sorry Tom,This could not have been a bigger disappointment it they tried. Tom Clancy deserves much better. This cant even be called an adaptation because it had nothing to do with the novel. The acting was wooden the plot was weak and ludicrous and even MBJ seemed to be phoning it in which I am very sorry to say. The technical inaccuracies made it difficult to even enjoy the action which really wasnt that enjoyable anyway. Basically this could have been a better movie if they had left it to a couple of shaved wombats for writing and directing. As a John Clark fan from way back it was the absolute worst way that they could have told his story. MBJ could have knocked it out of the park if he had something better to work with.,1.0,3596
ebaker-63744, Terrible waste of my time and yours!,The script writers should be ashamed of themselves. I read all of Clancys books and have always loved without remorse. This movie has only two things correct to the book:1: The main characters name is John Kelly/Clark2: He is/was a Navy SEAL.Tom Clancy is rolling in his grave at this terrible adaptation.Side note: I love reading the reviews from people saying that the only reason people are giving this movie terrible reviews is because they cant handle an African American as the main character. What a joke.,1.0,3597
lrm-33361, Disappointed... Not a Tom Clancy story.,I loved Tom Clancy books and movies growing up and I always wanted them to make Without Remorse into a movie since the book was so good. I was thoroughly disappointed. The only commonality are some of the characters and the title. They could have just changed the character names and the title and not claim this to be a Tom Clancy film. Either stick with the plot of the books and do them justice or dont claim to do a Tom Clancy film. The plot they did use instead was stale and not what I would expect for a major release. It was more in the direct to DVD league.It also seems like they did not have very good technical advisors... or geographers. The opening scene takes place in a landlocked city and yet Kelly and his team infiltrate via water. The uniforms are also very inconsistent... Greer is wearing a commanders cap in at least one place which is different than what her rank would be. Since the writers took so much liberty with realism they just wrote her in as a SEAL instead of a more plausible role like being some sort of subject matter expert attached to Kellys team. Im not one to dismiss the idea that there are women out there capable of becoming Navy SEALs but I would expect the to be built like a crossfit games winner instead of the stereotypical model. I know this comes off as nitpicking but the filmmakers should know their audience. Tom Clancys books and previous films were always very detailed and realistic and this film was far from that.The one positive part of the film was Michael B. Jordans performance and the only reason I gave this any stars. I was excited to see him in the role when it was announced. He did well with what he had to work with. It is a real shame. Had they stuck to the plot of the book and took the details seriously I would be excited for Rainbow Six. Now I just hope they forget they planned on doing it.,2.0,3598
rncxwnxm, Stolen identity,The name was there and I expected the story to be abridged possibly significantly to a 2021 version but really? This was nothing at all like the story not even a little. It was like they took a random and not very good story and thought they could just use a few characters names to make it a Clancy. In my opinion the best book in the series and the very worst film. Disappointing.,1.0,3599
mparam-00226, Total disappointment,Except some action sequences nothing is good in this movie. There is no screen play and no story. Dont waste your time!!,1.0,3600
feyipuk, Stop using Tom Clancys name if it's not Clancy!,I havent read Without Remorse yet considering Amazon started business selling books why cant the writers of these productions read one if theyre going to say its based on one! Tom Clancy was the master of the techno-thriller mixing elements of science fiction political thriller and spy genres albeit Clancys extensive research helped readers understand foreign militaries and his plots eerily echoed real events to the degree rumours circulated the CIA thought he was a mole.This film has none of his subtlety. Yes its normal for books to change when made into a film but all that seems left of Clancys work are a few names.On the plus side Jamie Bell does get the sneaky company man role down. His spook demeanour in relation to the other soldiers is probably the most in keeping with Clancy.MBJ makes a decent effort as the lead who in typical Hollywood fashion is pretty trigger happy an amazing shot with grenades but never seems to be in much peril while Jodie Turner-Smith seems to only be allowed one emotion.On the other side Im not sure if Guy Pearce was just tired all the way through but compared to the usual energy he shows in his other films he was putting me to sleep.The cinematography is dark at places really hard to see what is going on. I get fighting in the dark adds to the effect but I ended up watching one of the early fight scenes three times and only found out what had happened later in the film. It shouldnt be that hard.The post credits scene should have filled me with joy but considering everything Id just seen it just left me more sad.,3.0,3601
kcp1062, Huge disappointment,I dont even know why Tom Clancy and his estate sold the rights to his books. The only movie that did justice to his books is Hunt for Red October.

IMDbCPT, What could have been,Reality is some people will enjoy this movie but most like those that will enjoy this movie have probably not read of any of Clancys novels and they are lucky they havent.I have read a few Clancy novels but even though I have not read this one you do have an expectation and this one sadly doesnt do Clancys words justice.This could have been such a great start to a franchise of movies.Seems like the Hollywood producers of this movie just decided let throw in explosions gun play we will have a block buster.For me Michael B Jordan just doesnt bring Clarke to life it feels like he over acted.If you enjoy action without story you will enjoy.If you like Clancy novels and enjoy his detail and story you will be bitterly disappointing.I am planning on reading the novel to see how bad they stuffed this one upNow to see what they do with Rainbow Six and this one I have readThis was not a good start.,1.0,3605

World-viewer," Silly, trite, revenge shoot-em-up. Worse than straight to DVD.","If the entire crew involved in the production of this abomination have no remorse they ought to have. Plenty of remorse. For subjecting an already traumatized public to this collection of pixelized garbage. This silly shootem-up deserves to be taken out back shot (without remorse) and buried in an anonymous plot never to be mentioned again ... or quarantined forever in Yucca Mountain along with all other radioactive waste.Re the ""movie"": There wasnt a lot of character development or laying the premise for a good story. Scratch that. There was none. Plot holes are abundant and the story does not follow in most instances. It would have behooved the writers to have read some real life accounts of spies and covert action before contriving a clearly comically simple but hackneyed revenge plot using characters out of a novel they clearly did not bother to read. Clancy would by no means win any literature awards but at least he usually got the technical and operational details right usually to a fault. This is by far the worst adaptation of any Tom Clancy novel. The acting by most of the cast is wooden and phoned in. Its sad the only ""Guy"" with any real convincing portrayal is the villain. Throughout the movie youll be going - What?? Why??? How??? It really is that bad. Its like a bad Avengers movie met Get Smart on a 007 set.Unless action IS the plot - eg The Raid Extraction... Action and violence should be used sparingly and to further the plot of the movie. There should also be some sense and purpose to the action sequences. This movie - fuggeddaboutit.For example. And by no means an exhaustive list of ""huh why??"" forehead slapping moments that make one yell at the poor TV but a quick sampler. Spoilers ahead.Why would anyone think T-boning a car AT AN AIRPORT setting it on fire and jumping into it would be the best course of interrogating someone? And then jumping out and promptly EXPECTING to get arrested. What would you do with any info gained from that theatrical exercise in futility? Wait till the end of the prison sentence to act upon it? This is the type of plan an experienced SEAL would hatch? One that depends on the police pulling over a diplomatic vehicle?? Why would a nearly empty plane be operating with the interior lights on when even full passenger planes have their lights dimmed? Why was the first thought of a team thats fully geared up with parachutes and about to HAHO out of such a plane decide : No!! Were going to go down with the plane rather than jump especially when a missile strikes the plane? Who thinks that two black team members can easily blend in covertly into .... *ahem*.. Russia? How easy is it to just ""disappear"" after shooting up a city block... in Russia? And if the team was betrayed from the start and never expected to survive how is it they made their exfil presuming their treasonous paymasters were in on the whole plan from the beginning?As a wise former president observed many a year ago: ""Rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?"" Clearly the millennial generation writing these crappy movies still has a ways to go. Despite having a perfectly decent plot laid out for them in the book they still managed to royally screw up the movie - I mean how hard should it be really to make Rambo meets Death Wish?",1.0,3611

tspike911, Another good book destroyed by hollywood,I think this is why Tom Clancy didnt allow this book to be made into a film while he was alive he knew that hollywood would destroy it (and they did).I get it we need wokeness and inclusiveness in everything even in the most elite military units even if its not reality.I was going to write an in depth review on everything that was wrong or right with the movie in comparison to the book but I just care it wont make a difference.

kgqgcqbqcb, Wokeness ruins movies,The trailer made me really excited to watch this movie and I like MBJ. But this was not good. I mean this is not fantasy so why do they have a black female seal team leader? Stop trying so hard to be politically correct it doesnt work. And they could have at least cast someone that could act in that case...Also the lighting is absolutely terrible! Its soooo dark. You can barely see whats going on for a good part of the movie. 4 stars only for MBJ.,4.0,3634
averymor, Without Shame,I was really looking forward to this movie despite the character being played by MBJ who for the character was typed cast incorrectly. That should have been my first clue. Thats like having Luke Cage or Tchala played by a white actor. I never like when Hollywood does that. Still I gave it a chance. Read the book if you havent if you have as I did then you already know this Tom Clancy installment is an embarrassment on so many levels I lose count. It felt like they filmed it in less than a month without any attention to detail or forethought. Dont waste your time.,2.0,3635
deutero-49703, What has movie making come to?,I turned on a Tom Clancy movie thinking I was going to watch one of his intriguing international conflict movies with men fighting evil directly and with strength of mind body and a decent morality. I turned on this movie and the first 10 minutes shows a Navy SEAL team with a 90 lb black woman as the SEAL teams commanding officer in the field! I dont care if shes black white purple green blue whatever this ridiculous looking scenario with Navy SEAL military equipment on this womans body looking silly and giant compared to her frame just to make some kind of social engineering statement?!? Then it switches to the United States in the Pentagon where it finally shows her in a Navy SEAL uniform with ribbons on her chest and the seal insignia that very few men have the mental and physical capability to earn much less a 90 lb woman unless you change what it means to be a seal and at that point the whole intriguing glorious excellence and dedication of these men who pushed their God-given strength and dedication to the limits and beyond with the desire to protect the men  women and children of this nation from Evil tyrants who would force their will upon Americans is belittled and lost. There is one scene where this woman goes face to face with the antagonist in a scene where she is supposed to be popping up her chest and looking big and bad to threaten this man who is doing things that could cast her men in a bad light. That was one of the most silly ridiculous scenes Ive ever encountered in a Bee movie much less a movie thats been built up as much as this one has. I had to turn the TV off at that point because I was so embarrassed for this poor actress who Im sure could do great in a role as an actual woman in the strength of righteous womanhood. Movie makers youve not only lost your connection to the people of this nation youve lost your connection to reality as God designed it obviously clearly and without question. If you want to play games with deluding yourselves into thinking you do not live in a world with fixed spiritual physical and social laws by which humanity finds true relationship and true meaning and true purpose under the God that created us have at it! If you want to make skits for yourself all day and all night where guys become female impregnated aliens do it but leave us out of it and please get some people to make movies again that have excellent righteousness versus evil thematic elements where men reveal the reason for and purpose for their being bearing Authority and strength for the blessing and protection of others not some made up morality and reality where dogs are supposed to marry cats and a lion can declare himself an elephant legally.,1.0,3636
twhiting9275, Clancy would be very disappointed,"As far as the character (John Clark):Not only does the movie NOT follow the book it is a complete contrast to it. Things the author had established related to the character are no longer rewritten to satisfy certain agendas.As far as the movie:There have been some real stinkers in this series. Previously the worst (in my opinion) would have been The Sum of all Fears with Afleck. Surprisingly this movie sinks even further than that one to take the place of ""the worst"".

I guess after seeing how they made Jim Greer a muslim in the Jack Ryan series I shouldnt be surprised about this muddled mess. They dont even try to make it realistic.

The story of John Clark has been ingrained throughout all of Tom Clancys books and Without Remorse was the best selling novel on his backstory. If you had such a good story from such an acclaimed writer why would you ever throw it all away just so you could ""re-imagine"" it ?? If you have no history knowledge or love of Tom Clancys books then perhaps youll have some small amount of interest in just another typical Hollywood low-budget film.

diegocomin, The most expensive B-Movie I've ever seen,This movie Doenst do justice to Tom Clancy the US Navy the CIA and specially the Navy SEALS. It is not accurate (a female seal officer?) the uniforms are wrong. The story is all over the place. The acting is abysmal (think Steven Seagal circa the 90s) and you can actually see Guy Pierce is kind regretful to even be there.Technically speaking: the shots are dark. Mostly bad framed and the sound is way too loud.Finally: does not follow the original story. It was black washed just to meet the current Hollywood woke movement.

I can understand taking artistic liberties with parts of it to translate the story onto the big screen or even bring the story into the modern world but they didnt even do that. I was even pretty stoked with Michael B. Jordans casting. He has the range and depth to bring Clark to life just as well as any of the other actors who have. Instead they created a new plot and characters that barely remind us of the original. At this rate Im convinced they just wanted to cash in on the Clancey name not honor his work.,2.0,3648

mikbanerjee1, The Character of John Clark Deserved Better!,"With its formulaic modus operandi ""Without Remorse"" tragically conveyed the feel of true Remorse. Amazon Studios latest venture into Tom Clancys universe turned out to be a colossal disappointment! Atrocious Writing Mediocre Performances and Conspicuous Enfeeblement in terms of presenting its Action made the entire experience bitterer!Right from its introductory sequence; I realized something amiss. In spite of the fact that it immediately gets underway with Gunfight & Explosions the particular way in which they handle all of it created an impression of nonchalance!Excluding some gratifying moments that clearly demonstrate Cinematographic flair; in other parts its got its own set of problems! Such as the Score; frequently masking pivotal parts of every other conversation. Furthermore Lighting in certain scenes appears to be too dim. Likewise the Screenplay inflicted with apathy often enough! Translating into an uninspiring array of events.Speaking of Performances I find them to be average at best. Michael B. Jordan is a known performer and we are all aware of his capabilities as an actor. With such shoddy script in hand; there was nothing he could do. From my point of view the character of John Kelly/Clark deserved greater representativity!All things considered; personally this hasnt been a pleasant viewing not a bit! Efforts had been made to do things differently but they failed to bring into play two principal constituents of any Action Flick; i.e. Thrill and Vehemence!",2.0,3650
briandickie-39038, This is not any relation to a Tom Clancy book of the same title.,John Clark or Kelly as the character starts out is a Navy Seal.Admiral Jim Greers normally played by the superb James Earl Jones is not featured in this but the characters niece is who is John Clarks team leader.Jamie Bell plays Ritter who we all know is a future corrupt CIA Director of Intelligence.... Maybe he will be good before his corruption in later books but no this story has him outed as a villain in the first spoken scenes.Here ends any relation to the Tom Clancy storylines. And my interest in the story wavered further and further as the film progressed.Add in a few action sequences lots of meaningless jibber jabber to set up a plot line that has descended from retiring seal to covert ops although for which agency is strangely lacking. Maybe its cia but none of it fits any notion of a military or intelligence structure.Acting: Jamie Bell lacks any depth motivation and background. The actress playing Greer is to be avoided basically a wooden character with presence which isnt utilised at all seems like a missed opportunity. Michael B Jordan is limited to silent operative and angry husband and superman but there is no depth.Just weird.... Thats some of the actions and set peices bits of floor that fall away climbing into burning cars to interview suspects arrests that dont make sense threats and hostility for show. when Kelly is imprisoned for unknown reasons no trial with russian mobsters. The panache of Clancy is nowhere to be seen what we see is corruption everywhere action scenes which are just plain non sensical such as Kelly vs 3 Prision Guards in full riot gear with helmets shields and batons you can guess its never going to be a fair match Kelly is of course an overwhelming opponent.I honestly couldnt tell you what i detested more about this film.... The acting.... 2/10. The story 1/10. The identity politics 0/10.Overall the key to Tom Clancy novels making it well to the screen is to have some tenet of link back to the books some have been very faithful HFROctober Patriot Games etc. Some have been weak - SOAFears.... Some have been unfaithful the recent amazon Jack Ryan shows but were true to the moral of an Analyst working their way up.... This film i can only conclude had the title and character names of some well known Clancy characters but none of the substance or integrity or story.... Add in an act of war by America on Russian a Jet Plane crash in which everyone survives with no injuries.... Its just garbage and not fit for the film title and characters names.I feel sorry for the careers that could well be ruined by this film. The only reason why i dont give this film 1/10 is that its not a home movie and it gets a 2/10 because to be fair on the cell sequence the use of water and M B Jordans physique is impressive.If you decide to watch this.....

djdiabolikal, What in the Ever Loving !#%*,I have been waiting years for someone to make a Tom Clancy movie and when I saw the trailer for this and it was staring Michael B Jordan I couldnt be more exited. I gathered my whole family up and with great anticipation we started to watch. With in minutes it was clear this was not going to be the movie I thought it was going to be and by the end the consensus was that we had just watched a pretty awful movie. There is almost no plot and what plot there is is the most contrite drivel you could imagine. This is a movie you have seen at least two dozen times and out of those 23 were a better movie that this. The acting is stiff even from the usually fantastic Michael B Jordan there is zero character development and you have no investment in how anything turns out. There is literally probably less than 10 minutes of action and what is there is unimaginative and boring. I love action movies and think that even a lot of lower budget poorly made ones at least have some worthwhile parts but with this movie I can honestly say that there isnt one thing I could point to in this movie that had any entertainment value. Even taking out the high expectation I went into this with I can truly say this is one of the worst most disappointing movies I have ever seen.,1.0,3654
nm169, Dismal,I have read the book - many times. Its excellent. I had hoped that the movie would keep some semblance of the story. It barely did. A guy called Kelly whose wife was killed.

tryan-98978, Appalling,Yet another movie trying to be woke. Instead of going off the book and having a 6 foot tall Irish-American we get MBJ who in my opinion is not a good actor. They needed someone like Cole Hauser. Who actually fits the character of John Kelly. The movie was trash. They threw in scenes around water or using water in just gimmicky ways that made no impact on the film. They have a shootout that looks like they were trying to imitate the Tom Clancy Rainbow Six video game. Its like they never actually read the book they just read the cliff notes and took it in a completely make it up as you go last minute piece of garbage assignment that they didnt really want to do.If you have not read the book do not read it before watching this dumpster fire you WILL be disappointed. If you have watched the movie and havent read the book I highly recommend you stop reading this and immediately pick up the book. You will not be disappointed in the least.,1.0,3660

With that aside I pressed on. The acting was average at best and the film itself was an average action shooter.

I figured it was going to be made into a series and piggyback on the successful Jack Ryan series they have been doing on Prime. Not only was this not a Clancy story aside from some characters and that someone he cared for died that makes him want revenge the story was a tired one. Not to give any spoilers but you have seen this story before just wrapped up in a different spy series.

Think about it we have the screenwriter of Sicario the Director of Sicario 2 Jonsi composing the editor of Drive; all of this should make for a good action flick thatll set up Rainbow Six.Aaaaand once again we get another book adaptation that completely disregards the acclaimed book that its adapting. Those issues aside the film was badly paced; the dialogue scenes felt too slow while the action scenes felt boring and there was a lack of build-up to both. The films casting was ok with Michael B Jordan giving a good performance as John Kelly. Jodie Turner-Smith though wasnt that good and felt out of place.

metroplexdj, Watched With Remorse,What a steaming pile of dung. This movie has nothing to do with iconic characters created by Tom Clancy.,3.0,3691
i-cusick, Without Remorse? Without Sense,I knew in advance this wasnt based on the book of the same name written early 90s based in early 70s so I wasnt let down by that.I was let down by the story the over acting the poor pacing the poor lighting the action sequences. Even the normally reliable MIchael B Jordan cant save it.I realise this is an introduction before Rainbow Six but this has put me off watching that.Very poor so disappointing.,1.0,3692
btrimble-57267, Too much hollywood ruins clancy genius,Pure disappointment! This was the first Clancy book I read on my first deployment overseas. If they would have just stuck to the book the ratings would be better. The decompression chamber scene from the book alone would have been talked about just like the Red Wedding from G. O. T!Lots of bad acting several scenes you can actually see the actors looking for their mark. Did they even hire a qualified military consultant for the action sequences? Did the director listen to them if they did? (Rhetorical question)I know it was a production that primarily took place before covid but come on man! This movie was predictable from the opening scene to the very end and it doesnt help when you throw in the anti-government sentiment.To sum it up...There is not enough kitty litter to fill all the holes in this film!,2.0,3693

This is all within the first 2 minutes.The Russian in the car with petrol on it cant escape but the door easily opens from outside.The commander is a woman...

dallorens426, Without Remorse?,"Wow! What an incredibly bad movie adaptation of a great book! Im glad Tom Clancy is no longer alive to see what they did to one of his great stories. The young man who plays ""John Kelly/Clark"" is a good actor who I have seen in several roles. I like his talent. There were some other good actors in the movie not including Guy Pearce. First problem the story does not resemble the book which was an outstanding idea. Second John Clark has been in so many of the film adaptations and in the Clancy novels as a white male that I found it a little distracting to now have a younger black man in the role. I think he would have been outstanding in the role of Greer. Greer was horribly cast in this movie and I wont go into the whole a woman as a navy seal and team commander. Hollywood attempting to tell everyone that a woman can do everything a man can do but hey men cant do everything that women do. I know Hollywood wont be happy until men are playing the role of expectant mothers. I dont even want to think about that! I was so disappointed by this movie but it wont surprise me when everyone gets an academy award for this movie. Why couldnt the producer just make a great movie from a great novel by a great writer. Dont waste time watching this movie unless you just want to be disappointed.",3.0,3699

texaskelt-18634, Dull and Disappointing,Without Remorse may be my favorite Tom Clancy book. So while expecting a somewhat updated theme like the Jack Ryan series this had absolutely no comparison with the original story line.It may not be PC but having a female SEAL officer is just gratuitous and absurd.The entire plot line seemed disjointed like key scenes had been cut. The lead character was flat and despite some descent action it was boring. The book is quite emotional and you feel sympathy for the protagonist. Absolutely no compelling characters in this movie adaptation.,1.0,3701
keithdustindesigns, It's stupid to even call this a Clancy based movie.,"This movie make zero sense other than they wanted Tom Clancy in the title of of the movie. It literally has nothing to do with the books or the characters.One John Kelly aka Clarks wife and daughter are not only alive but his daughter is married to his second in command Ding Chavez. In the books the origin of John Clark has him in his mid to late 20s with his story ending with him being married to Pam and having a daughter on the way. The Rainbow Group happens a little over 20 years later with his daughter being married to his younger second in command.Currently John Clark is in his early 70s and is in charge of his new group of operators  ""The Campus"" and Jack Ryan Jr. Is one of his agents.Nothing about the movie makes sense as it relates to the ongoing books.While I appreciate they have to make changes they would have been better off setting this up in the late 70s or early 80s.Spoiler but not reallyThe movie on its own regardless of the books was also ridiculous on its own. How many people gather around in a street while an active sniper is shooting? How many cops simply walk around in an active shooter sequence when two of their own get shot. I mean just meandering around.",1.0,3702

daddygracenyc, Female Lieutenant Commander Was Unbelievable,First let me say there are no female Nave Seals in the United States Navy. Jodie Turner-Smith was horrible in this movie trying to portray a military officers with martial arts fighting and leadership skills. Not only is the actress is from the United Kingdom there are many qualified female native born Americans that could have been chosen to play this role. It is disappointing to see so many actors from the United Kingdom portraying U. S. citizens in movies instead of casting real Americans which is providing jobs from our own. This movie was horrible and the plot was subpar. Amazon did a poor job with making this movie. If I didnt have an Amazon Prime account I would pay money to see this garbage.,1.0,3710

catherine_odonnell, I hope somebody actually makes Without Remorse someday,If you just want an action movie with some plot twists this is a fine film. Maybe worth a 6. The dialog was flat. Not sure if it was bad script or bad acting/ directing but the characters didnt pull me in. I was not at all offended by a black John Kelly or a female spec ops commander in concept. I just didnt find these portrayals credible.If you wanted to watch Clarks story from Tom Clancys novels you will have to wait. This wasnt it in any respect. Given how prominently the tie to Clancy was in the marketing I think its quite fair to ding them in this review for disappointing us. If you came here to watch a Tom Clancy story especially one with as much in it as Clarks story should have this film was a great disappointment. A four rating is overly generous in that respect. I read and agree with many of the 1 and 2 reviews.,4.0,3714

However the character of Clark in this movie is no where in any of Clancys work. No where. This is not the Clark that was created in the book ""Without Remorse."" Why did they create this mess? Why? Did they think the material is dated? Why even link this material to Tom Clancy? It might have been a half-decent movie if I hadnt been so excited to see Clark come to life to only see this unimaginable and indescribable bomb.

It was so painful to watch that i add to stop the movie and i can honestly say this rarely happens. Acting is so bad that it gets confusing. Is this a comedy ? No. It says action movie. Even B. Jordan is nothing but convincing. Another thing that was a little disturbing was that all the bad guys in the movie were portayed by white actors and the good guys were all black.

Yet you are able to kidnap this man at a washroom in a restaurant without any struggle and drive him off a bridge to his death? Even John Wick couldnt pull that off. And to even make matters worse how can one man have a shootout with an army of Russian soldiers in a building not get shot jump into an ambulance and drive off? So unreal.

CryptoGuy, Buckle Up for a Mediocre Ride,Overall I found Without Remorse disappointing. While a mediocre action film that was mildly entertaining this was not by any imagination an adaptation of Tom Clancys Without Remorse.Probably one of Clancys finest books Sheridan and Staples manage to shred anything remotely close to the novel. Rather than a realistic portrayal of a man filled with rage and bent on revenge as he walks the tightrope between self-destruction and duty we get a stylized military version of John Wick.Dont get me wrong I love the John Wick movies. Theyre entertaining fun not to take too seriously. Without Remorse (the movie) hits those same notes. But thats not why Clancy fans have waited decades to see this story come to the screen.But if this movie hits the same John Wick notes then why is it mildly entertaining? The film takes itself seriously and it is hard to accept. Not too mention some questionable choices from the writers and director that are just hard to swallow.Poor logistical choices for locations ridiculous military representations that make Godzilla movies seem like Pentagon training videos poor casting and a Swiss cheese script keep Without Remorse from being memorable.Stefano Sollima was absolutely the wrong director for this project. Based solely on his work on Sicario: Day of the Soldado the acceptable sequel to Sicario Sollima is a quasi cohort for Sheridan. But Sollima lacks the sophistication to truly tell a compelling story and directs this picture as a Sheridan lapdog instead. Frankly Sollima stinks and should stick to television.Tyler Sheridan approached the adaptation with a bug gnawing an idea in the back of his head. Hes currently developing a television series about the first female Navy Seal. Obviously a fantasy piece thats already been done with G. I. Jane Sheridan believes he can put a new spin on the idea. Here he tests the waters with Without Remorse and the water is cold.Karen Greer played by Jodie Turner-Smith is a one-dimensional piece of wood. And Turner-Smith has as much range as a squirt gun. Not too mention she doesnt come close to the type of woman that could prevail as a Navy Seal. A miss by all accounts.Jordan as the lead John Clark managed to breathe as much life into a dead-eyed version of the character from the book he could muster. Frankly the writers and director set him up for failure but he somehow still came out unscathed.Without Remorse is filled with implausible action sequences a plot weve seen a million times stiff acting and a predictable ending that doesnt even try. Three stars is being nice and is for Jordan only.,3.0,3746

peterDM-30380, Waste of Talent,What I got from this movie is that Michael B. Jordan is a really talented actor who deserves much better scripts than this.

At least someone put their heart into the reviews and you feel like they cared ... unlike anything in this movie. There are some good actors here so I dont think its the acting must be the writing? Its just bad. Im extremely disappointed.I didnt read the book so I am not going to compare to that. I will just say that I agree with others - this feels like another heartless Steven Segal flick with no humor or one-liners to look forward to. I play the games and was looking forward to the story and hopefully tieing this into Jack Ryan. Instead I hope they either scap this and start over with better writing story and directing or they really make a lot of changes for the sequel.3 stars for the MBJ shirtless scenes (lol) and the post credit scene only because of the lead off into what can only be a better movie.,3.0,3770
w-vogt, Trainwreck,Not a Tom Clancy movie. Horrible story stupid characters. A complete directing and production failure.And ofc there had to be a female seal team leader. There are many movies with strong and good female action performances. This crap is not one of them.Avoid at all cost!!!,1.0,3771
docbennettstid, Poor Tom Clancy,The producers took a ready made great story and ruined it. Mr Clancy served up a ready made multi movie hero America could love. Our own James Bond.These idiots destroyed it.Fight scene in prison. Main character has zero scars after recently receiving at least two gunshot wounds to the chest.Poor producing & directing.,1.0,3772
3fittyz, This is not Without Remorse by Tom Clancy,"This was a great book. About 95% of the plot and original story is tossed. Ive been waiting for someone to make this a movie/limited series for 30 years. You really could have called it anything else and not paid for the rights. No one would have noticed. Its a decent B movie if it wasnt titled as ""Without Remorse"" from the Clancy novel. It should have been called ""We couldnt find Jason Bourne but made a Bourne movie anyways"".Please dont butcher Debt of Honor or Red Storm Rising. Maybe let Netflix have a go at Tom Clancy novels since whoever made and scripted this movie obviously never read the series or even this book.The book was a record best seller for a reason. This movie is nothing by comparison.",1.0,3773

lumiakinmurele, Hollywood strikes again. Dumb and Dull.,This movie has nothing to do with the book. Zilch. The main thing that drove the book was the relationship between Kelly and Pam and how Pams death at the hands of a drug kingpin preceded by the loss of Kellys wife and baby drove his decisions. Here Pam is now miraculously his wife and she only has less than three minutes of screen time. Utterly pathetic. Theres no emotional core to the story no one to care about.And who the hell walks into a burning car and sits in the burning car asking for information? Dumb overall.,6.0,3775
kevinmacmurray, Not Recommended,Well below average for a Tom Clancy story. It does have a lot of action scenes but the acting is mediocre and the storyline is disjointed. Extremely disappointed. You cant see half the movie because the picture is so dark. And its not my TV. Brand new QLED which has a beautiful bright picture.I was not expecting an Academy Award winner but this just fell way below my expectations.,1.0,3776
wheelerteia, Disappointment,It was a fail for me. I was uninterested after the wife died  the movie falls completely flat after that. I never read the book but I hate how after his wife dies we see no funeral til the end of the movie he never seems to mourn. Bad acting especially Jodie Turner Smith idk how she landed the roll. The scene the planes goes into the water you can tell its a pool. The plot twist was obvious and weak . Micheal Bs acting was bad as well was impressed with his action scenes tho.,3.0,3777
hedrummond, Cacaphony,Loud and irritating to the point my body shut down from being over exposed to all the noise and stupidness. Honestly there are four good reasons not to.watch this film and that is Michael B. Jordan Jodie Turner-Smith Jamie Bell and Guy Pearce and that is because it is so bad it makes you kind of wonder how these really good charismatic people could get involved in such a profoundly odius piece of garbage. This certainly was one big tooth ache. Just kind of made me mad for watching it from the beginning to the very last frame. I just couldnt find anything about it to recommend it except maybe to put in the list of totally bad films to warn people to steer clear of. That ending. God! What was that? Couldnt they make up their minds on how to end it? I thought it was done but then it wasnt and then instead of just going into that good night they came back with more so that they could maybe do what? Make another bad film using the same cast? Sorry but its that bad. I cant even tell you what the story was about except revenge or was it about retribution? Really suckie bad script writing. I hope to the good Lord that this is a spoiler.Does this review contain spoilers?YesNo.,1.0,3778

RobTortureWright, One of the worst.,"""What if us getting shot down wasnt an accident"" That level of stupidity in a sentence sums up this film. Genuinely one of the worst films Ive seen in a long time and Ill explain why. First off the story is non existent Russians vs Americans but nowhere near as good as it sounds next up the the characters are like comic book characters heres the bad guy heres the good guy now watch some awful action scenes. And finally the acting and dialogue in this film are simply laughable several clearly dubbed lines and the emotions displayed in scenes where somebody is meant to be shot or feeling pain are so fake it hurts. The sound of shots being fired is better than any comedy Ive seen all year little pew pew pinging noises its hilarious. Overall Im disappointed I wasted my time on this film and they should remove Tom Clancys name from the film better yet just remove the film altogether.",3.0,3782

And then Michael B. Jordan starts throwing grenades and gunning these Russian cops down even tho he said ""The bad guy was shooting at the cops to frame us."" (paraphrased). This was just one of many other crimes he commits thru out the movie. And at the end hes like ""Hey you know that corrupt government program/agency that does bad stuff? Lets ask that same government to create another government program that does good stuff"" (paraphrased). What a dope.This is not a good movie.

jujutsuweasel, Tom Clancy had nothing to do with this atrocity,Within the first 10 minutes I realized that this movie was an atrocity of filmmaking. I mean I why wouldnt we steal the title from an actual good book and turn it in to a movie that should never have happened? To call this cliche would have been a compliment but no cliche was left unturned. I dont have a lot of compliments for this ludicrous edition. Storytelling is gone. Has any Amazon movie employee ever actually read a book or are they just playing Call of Duty and trying to turn it into a movie? No talent was used in the making of this movie.,1.0,3788
MattViglas, not Without Remorse,Lets be clear. This is not the movie without remorse. The only thing in common with the book is his name. If the movie was called something else and they wanted to use the John Clark name that would of been ok. But calling this Without Remorse is an insult to Tom Clancys creative talent. The movie on its own deserves a 5 star at best. Stealing the name entitles it to a 1 star.I can only prey they dont mess up Rainbow Six as badly because it was a pretty cool book with entertaining characters.,1.0,3789
saintlad-82868, Enough of the Wokeness casting stunts already.....,I was willing to give Michael B Jordan a chance because he typically is a good actor but just terrible casting of Jodie Turner Smith as Lt Commander.

dbinder-99910," Awful, dark rooms nothing like the book",This film was total rubbish I can only assume the better reviews are staff family and friends. Virtually all was filmed in dark unlit areas. A little bit of unbelievability and action I can accept but this stretches beyond acceptable levels. I have enjoyed previous Clancy books and films but this pathetic effort follows nothing of the book other than throwing in some sort of familiar names in the hope to deceive you into thinking it is real Clancy. I assume to use his name permission must have been given perhaps Clancy was having a bad day when he read the script. During periods of boredom - most of it - I even found myself talking to the wife checking messages and constantly wondering how much longer! Dont waste your time.,1.0,3795
tddiscodriver, Way to butcher a great book.,"The first Tom Clancy book I read way back in 1996 was ""Without Remorse"" and I was hooked. Tom Clancy was a smart story teller full of detail and character.So I was looking forward to watching this. What a disappointment. This movie has NOTHING and I mean NOTHING to do with the book. The title could have been ""Just another bad action movie""The story is weak and makes little sense.Plot holes you can drive a truck through.Average acting might be forgiven because of the woeful script.Theres so much wrong with this movie it really was insulting to watch.Kelly is shot in both shoulders and in the abdomen but when he takes his top off before the prison fight he doesnt have a scar on him. He has limp that comes and goes throughout the film.Tom Clancy must be spinning in his grave.

svkndv," Tom Clancy, you too?",A movie without any logic appears to me like a story born out of brain with IQ less than 90.Overall quality of graphics at par with those made by big banners.They made it too simple to enter Russia and shoot down russian authority.

useranonymous-00865, Not accurate,Decent action scenes but thats about it. Not much about this movie is remotely realistic. From the gear the Seals use to the sound of the suppressed firearms almost none of it was accurate. I also dont like how they added a female Seal just for the sake of adding more gender diversity. Im a Michael B Jordan fan and have no issues with him playing his role. I just wish they would have done a better job with the content of the movie. Very disappointing.,1.0,3806

thebert-29966, Terrible - Think low budget action movie,This movie is terrible and having a Tom Clancy tag makes it even worse. Right from the beginning there is an active duty female special forces Lt. Cornel who weighs 90lbs. No. Casting is terrible. The dialogue through the movie is unrealistic and doesnt flow.The good guys always hit there target and the bad guys die instantly. Pounds worth of explosives blow up by the good guys powerful enough to blow out brick walls - but the good guys are ok. Multiple snipers miss shots I could make from the building across the street.Tom Clancy movies are generally well developed and very detail oriented. No details of what the team is going to do and how there going to do it are shared with the audience. They just hop in a plane and go for it like its a low budget action film. Cmon the secretary of defense and head of the CIA arent going to meet in a field trailer and make decisions in person directly to special forces.Who is on the special forces team? You dont even know the names of the other guys. Absolutely no character development.I couldnt even finish it.,1.0,3809
soules-04336, Not Tom Clancy,This was an amazing disappointment. The only similarity between the book and this piece of trash were the inaccurate name assignments. They used the title Without Remorse to lure in the Tom Clancy fan base. They could not have read the book. If you were hoping for a Red October/ Clear and Present Danger experience you will be highly disappointed. The acting was horrible with sub standard action sequences. Tom Clancy is turning in his grave as his legacy continues to spiral downward in search of easy money. The Crystal Skull for the Indiana Jones series had more integrity. I was really looking forward to this chapter in the John Clark timeline. What a serious let down. You can only hope a serious director/ producer team will sometime decide to make a real rendition of a fantastic book.

cornallyp, Ruined by terrible acting and bad direction,Im not a fan of MBJ imo hes a ridiculously overrated terrible actor but Im a big fan of special ops type movies so was hoping for the best for this one but unfortunately it was a complete waste of time. So many bad scenes that just didnt fit together and were so badly acted. Overacting in many parts and a complete lack of energy on others that didnt fit the urgency of the scene.

metalmilitia-69790, NOT TOM CLANCY IN ANY WAY,"I havent read many Tom Clancy novels but I love ""Tom Clancys Without Remorse"" the book. I do not love ""Tom Clancys Without Remorse"" the movie. It has nothing to do with the books plot or characters its not set in the same time period and Im pretty sure these people made a generic action movie but they were afraid that nobody would see it so they changed the main characters name slapped poor Tom Clancys name on it (because Tom wont object to it ever since he stopped needing oxygen) and hoped that people would watch it based on false titling. I hate this movie for that reason. If they had called this movie literally anything else I would have given it at least 6 stars. Its a 6 star movie but being labeled as ""Tom Clancys Without Remorse"" 1 star is too much. But I couldnt tell you how much you shouldnt expect to actually see a faithful adaptation of a great novel without at least putting a star on. So.....be warned.

mertesjeff, Shameful to Clancy's memory!,I have never written a review on this website but this movie was so asinine I had to make an account. I understand they cant use the real plot for Clancy Vince flynn books etc. Because the plots are too complex and actually interesting for the average movie watcher to understand. However the plot for without remorse was so far fetched I had to take a moment to process if this was a satire. To think a navy seal could just murder a foreign dignitary at the airport in front of everyone and one.. not be shot and two just not have immense press coverage and absolutely zero chance of being released from jail for a goose chase. But the worst thing of all in this movie is how the CIA is portrayed. Tom Clancy made his fortune off of writing about the CIA.. has anyone heard of jack ryan? How could they make the CIA look so incompetent that they wouldnt realize a plot to stage a war for Christs sake!? The CIA director was horrendous and that agent was so shameful. Dont you think that the CIA people would know more about espionage than a Navy SEAL..? After all it is there jobs! There was no communication between the cia and the president or any government about a literal war with Russia lol.. What do you think the CIAs job is?? To say this is tied in with jack Ryan is embarrassing. Yeah of course the navy seals are deployed into Russia without anyone having to talk to the president..but I guess thats why this is a basic streaming movie and not an HBO original or something.. they couldnt afford any writers that knew jack s*** about foreign policy or espionage and just hoped people would like the action. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the gun play and how the seals communicated was slightly realistic at some points.,2.0,3839

The action seems are dumb. The movie shares the name of the book along with the names of a few characters. The book is about him saving a drugged out prostitute and then her getting killed which brings him to a place of full on revenge. Also the story flashes back to his time in Vietnam as snake. This would have been a good story. Instead Amazon and this director did what numerous others have done and had some shady government operators do the main character dirty while killing his team mates and his wife. This movie stole the plot line of numerous movies while stealing the title from Tom Clancey.

slam163," Lazy, unoriginal, predictable","""Tough good guy seeks revenge after wife and child are murdered"" is a stock movie plot thats probably been done way too many times but there are ways to make it interesting. This film doesnt. It just delivers a cookie-cutter revenge plot mixes in a few dozen more well-worn tropes and plods its way to the end.The big reveal and the twist ending were both predictable from early on and significant parts of the plot didnt make sense. The story itself felt disjointed lurching from one set-piece action scene to another. It felt very much as if the writers had given up and were just phoning it in.The target audience is clearly people who like guns and soldiers way too much but the filmmakers then made the baffling decision to throw in a Black female Navy SEAL commander infuriating and alienating the very demographic that the movie was made for. The character incidentally is perhaps the only one in the film who has any kind of screen presence. Shes not believable as a military bad-ass but she is at least interesting to watch not something that can be said for any other character in the film.The same apathy that infected the writers seems to have spread to most of the actors. Even the often-excellent Guy Pearce looks like a man whos mostly thinking about his paycheck. Jodie Turner-Smith does a capable job with few words and subtle gestures but shes probably in the wrong movie. Michael B. Jordan just seems numbed not so much by personal tragedy as by dull writing. He too deserves a better movie: here he delivers a by-the-numbers performance for a by-the-number script.",2.0,3891

Bad cinematography. Bad writing. No realism. Bad sound mixing. Scenes so dark it makes the battle for winter fell seem bright.

jtighe-44630, Bad decisions lead to disappointment,"Having read every Tom Clancy book and been waiting for a big screen adaptation of ""Without Remorse"" since it released. I was looking forward to this. Boy was I disappointed. The decision to not follow the book was the biggest mistake that any studio could make. The change in character for John Kelly/Clark is easy to go with. Michael B. Jordon fits the role and can sell that level of angst and determination that John Kelly/Clark portrays in the book. However the change in story does a HUGE disservice to the source material and the author. I would not be surprised if the Clancy estate does not give permission for any more of his books after this. After the backlash that this movie is receiving I would not be surprised to see the studios next movie"" Rainbow 6"" follow the book more closely.",1.0,3897

This cannot be called a Tom Clancy film as there is no representation to his story character development of his attention to detail with regards to the military.This is some woke PC grade school level play pretending to be Tom Clancy. The depth of the writers research must have been reading the slipcover for the book ""Without Remorse"" and gone no further.If you are a Tom Clancy fan most definitely skip this pathetic cash grab on Clancys name.I you are a fan of good filmmaking or good script writing then this one is not for you either. There is nothing redeeming about this movie.",1.0,3900
ghostsm, John Clark you are not.,There are two things that this movie and book has in common. The tittle and name of the main character. Thats it. I dont see why they would spend the money to get the rights to the book and not adapt it.Yes the book is set in the 70s and deals with Vietnam War but Marvel has show you can modernize a dated story and keep its spirit with Ironman. This is just another attempt at virtual signaling by Hollywood by race swapping John Clark.The movie tease that it will go from Without Remorse to Rainbow Six. They going to skip over the years Clark worked with Ryan. Given that Rainbow Six (the book) takes place later in Clarks life and when he no longer an operator I expect that movie will only be a Tom Clancy story in name only too.,1.0,3901
kdoc13, Shockingly awful.,"As said in other reviews this strays very far from the source material. John Clark is now John Kelly Jim Greer is now Karen Greer which is good because the original characters are now not sullied by the taint of this festering tur.... They do make Karen Jims niece. Michael B. Jordan who is ordinarily good in anything is almost emotionless and wooden even mourning his wife and baby is momentary and unbelievable. Watch it then rewind and imagine him on the toilet making that same face and noise while having an uncomfortable bowel movement. They are interchangeable. Jodie Turner Smith ordinarily gorgeous and good delivers every line like shes either reading it for the first time or channeling Don King touting ""double shock power"" (which FYI is way more entertaining look it up on YouTube.) She cant even order someone to take a drink without it sounding boring and almost childish. She has no energy no emotion and is easily the weakest part of an already weak movie. Her agent must be legendary to get her acting roles after this. There was more emotion in the dead behind the eyes twins in ""Valerian."" Jamie Bell and Guy Pierce are underutilized and one dimensional. The action pieces are boring predictable and at times unbelievably stupid. Like setting a Russian Ambassadors car on fire and then climbing in it to talk. Even the ending and ""twist"" are predictable. It takes a well thought out Tom Clancy book and makes it a modern Blaxploitation revenge flick set against a minor political backdrop. Actually I wish it was blaxploitation it might have been better with Rudy Ray Moore.",2.0,3902

And why is this important - because alongside with Jack Ryan John Kelly is the other most important character in the whole Clancys universeIf you own the copyright - then simply follow the book and youll have successful movie.

tjbrill, Missed Opportunity,Tom Clancy fans will be disappointed in this story as it has nothing to do with the book which was one of the best storylines in the series. Other than the title and a few character names the plot does not do justice to the book. Sadly what viewers are being robbed of is the book explores Clarks tragically dark past Pams struggles and how he ultimately becomes Clark and the movie does not. As Clark avenges Pams death alone in the book by stalking Pams killers the movie leaps to some weird USA vs Russia plot and misses the boat all together. For people unfamiliar with the Clancy books the movie will probably be OK but regardless the original book plot would have made a much better movie for everyone.,2.0,3914

Well this movie is 109 minutes of that. Its a big let down.,2.0,3916
andyny-18817, Unlike other Clancy Movies,There is lots of action and many booming sounds in this flick. But there is no realism. The star Michael B Jordan gets shot twice in the chest early on. But he recovers. Then he gets shot down while in a plane that crashes into the ocean. He seems to hold his breath longer than any sea creature could and swims to the surface. Later on he drives a vehicle into water off a pier and sinks with the car and again holds his breath longer than a sea turtle could and escapes. All this while evading bullets from high powered rifles throughout the movie. And of course the plot is typical and easy to figure out. And much of the shooting occurs in Russia and he never gets caught. Other than that well its ridiculous in my opinion.,2.0,3917

S. police in front of a diplomats house at the airport coming out of a burning car and just while he was walking on the street.Editing and writing is very disappointing as well. The whole airplane sequence could have been omitted to keep the pace in a more efficient order.Despite being pretentious in its criticism it tries to convey the assumption that just because you defeat an ""evil"" empire does not mean you will replace it with a good one.",5.0,3923
copjdo, Great action - zero to do with Clancy's story,The action scenes were great best part about the movie. I like Michael B Jordan as an actor but he is NOT John Clark. They irresponsibly changed Clark from a white man to Jordan and it did nothing for improving the story. Same with bringing in a female to play Greer and then not develop her the way Jim Greer was in the book - her part in the movie was shallow. Storyline was nothing like a modernization of the original.The Without Remorse story was a redemption growth story that was one of Tom Clancys best - this is definitely not that. If you are a fan of Clancy skip this movie - it is a pathetic mockery of his work.,2.0,3924
wgeddings, Implausible waste of great actors and story,"I love Tom Clancy books and like others was excited to hear this movie was coming out. I like Michael B Jordan and had no qualms imagining him in the role other than he is a bit young for the character. I was disappointed to hear the movie would deviate from the book but I could deal with that. What I could not accept was that it was slow and boring. John Clark is supposed to kick butt and while MBJ had moments I blame the lackluster script. Adding LT Commander Karen Greer as a character also was offensive and ruined any realism. There are currently NO female Navy Seals much less a team lead reasonably high officer. Her character was pure Hollywood to be able to say they added a black woman. Every time she was on screen it took me out of the movie and reminded me that ""politically correct"" was more important than a good movie. All of the characters to some extent including John Kelly were incredibly two dimensional and neither relatable or interesting.Obviously the studio paid for the rights to the book but it is just sad that they only used the name to make a C level generic story with bad writing.",2.0,3925

It isnt that the film does not follow the novels plot that is troubling but that there is no authorial strength to what is offered. This films script feels as though it was drafted by a committee of individuals with an affection for comic book plots and filmed by a too devoted fan of film noir.,5.0,3926
kylereddy-85699, Bad!,While the plot of this movie makes it sound really interesting the execution certainly was not. MBJ definitely saves this movie as without him it would not be good at all. At times with this movie I found myself getting extremely bored and just counting the minutes until it ended. To be completely honest I thought after watching this movie that it was a waste of time. This was obviously disappointing because I really liked the trailers for this movie. In short the movie is boring and I would not recommend it.,4.0,3927

His acting skills are marginal at best and the characters emotional and traumatizing life had to be cast by someone who has more than one acting style.All in all this movie was lucky to get 4 stars.,4.0,3929
umrebel," Well funded and produced, but VERY formulaic and very Meh",No spoiler here because this movie is so completely formulaic you know everything from the preview and the dozens+ other movies youve already seen with this same plot. Bad guys kill badass military guys family but somehow he lives. Badass military guy recovers and proceeds to go rogue and kill everyone involved. The end. Also MBJ plays the same dang character in every movie hes ever been in. So I guess thats... himself? Range of a nerf gun. Its well funded and produced because it has the Tom Clancy name and Patriot Games back story baked in so its mildly entertaining ONLY in that respect.,5.0,3930
licoflorian, Cheesy,I must say this is one of the worst works of Sheridan for not saying the worse. Also Solima does not show his full capacity. I guess they stopped doing good movies. Nothing new nothing creative. One tough navy seal that manages to kill all and a very superficial way to unveil the . Please be creative. Get a little out of the lines and create some believe characters and story line. Otherwise there is no point in making movies and writing screenplays. Dont kill the good action!,1.0,3931
mr_sharma, So disappointing for so so many reasons,"You assemble a good cast. You throw money at it. So everything should look wooooh waaaaah and then you churn this out?I have seen this film a thousand times before in various guises over generations. Its an old plot with absolutely nothing new....not even the promised wooooh waaaah that a big budget would give.But its not for me. Old man river and all that. Maybe its for the younger generation. The young adults. The twenty somethings. Because chances are they havent seen a rip off of any polished turd of a movie from the 90s.This is so predictable and pedestrian I have to ask you to not bother.Action is stuff youve seen before. You never feel real peril or jeopardy.The worst of all is the ending. The explanation for why any of this happened is so lame....so written on a back of a cigarette packet (another 90s reference).....that you think that the world is run by actual idiots as opposed to me calling my brother an idiot (in a jokey way) when he accidentally switched on the electric toothbrush with toothpaste before he put the brush in his mouth....no not that type of idiot...the other one.There are scenes in this that are just pointless. The shirt off Michael B Jordan getting ready to box (a nudge and a wink to his role in Creed) but is just....why?I had no empathy for any of the characters in this.If you want to see an army unit do their thing and make it entertaining and almost authentic check out ""Mosul"".If you want one man non stop action check out ""Extraction"".There are so so many better films in this genre than this.Really unless you have a spare box of half eaten cold pizza and a rain soaked Sunday afternoon to kill there really is no reason to inflict this much waste of time on yourself.",4.0,3932
troy66, Awful book adaptation,I know movies are never 100% accurate to the book and was expecting this to be an updated 2021 version of a soldier returning from the Middle East. But other than the main characters and a couple others this movie is maybe 2% of the book storyline. I was so dissatisfied and disappointed in this completely awful version. Even if this was a movie with a different title it would be 3 out of 10 stars. Just terrible.,1.0,3933

cafard429, Disappointing,"The Clancy Estate must be regretting selling the rights to this producer. The only similarities are the title and the character names. The setting and plots near no relation to the original. To compound the issues with this abomination the screenplay goes well out of the way with ""woke culture"". I couldnt care less about the characters races but a female SEAL-qualified O-4 totally breaks verisimilitude for me. Action movies are aspirational for the audience but the message is lost to its primary demographic. It seems like the producers had a list of boxes to check and filled them without regard for the actual source. Im only 1:20 into this and its lost my attention. The plot is playing all the right tropes so its easily predictable. The only reason Im continuing with it is to see if and how John Kelly morphs into Mr. Clark. Im desperately praying the these producers dont have the rights to Rainbow Six.",2.0,3937

A few familiar character names zero plot points in common with the book. Tom Clancy is rolling in his grave but I guess his estate made a few more $$.Is it watchable.? Eh... barely. More useful as background noise while you do something else than your prime entertainment focus. As stated earlier its super generic.

oneeyedpauly, One of the most disjointed movies I've ever seen.,Ive not read the book so started watching this with an open mind regardless of the negative reviews. Its one of those movies that is so incredible bad you cant stop watching it just incase it gets better towards the end... it doesnt. Some of the action scenes are actually pretty good but the plot is all over the place and difficult to follow.

John Clark/Kelly was white and was in Vietnam not Syria. His girlfriend was killed by drug dealers. Absolutely nothing to do with this film. Poor acting and script but for Hollywood at least it was in keeping with their policy of having the right numbers of minorities regardless of ability. A sad day for Tom and his fans.,1.0,3945

Chief270, Forgot About Tom Clancy For A Moment,Its well established that other than the title a couple of character names and a very thin similarity to the most basic plot element (revenge) this movie has nothing to do with the Tom Clancy book. Set that aside for a moment.Without Remorse is a pretty bad movie. It is a carbon copy of a few Steven Seagal flicks from the late eighties-early nineties. Even the title sounds like a Segal flick. The acting is bad some plot details are beyond absurd technical details are sloppy every development is predictable and some of the action sequences are ridiculous.Back to Clancy. Without Remorse was a great book. It would be cool if someone made a movie actually based on the book rather than just the title. Thirty minutes into this movie I wanted to turn off the TV and read the book instead.,3.0,3948
karlgarz, Sick of Russia movies,So many Russia movies when Russia is no longer the prime danger to freedom and democracy. Chinese CCP are the prime threat to the free and democratic world and movies play an important role in pop culture.

Harry_Wild, Tom Clancy's With Remorse does not follow his book's storyline of that title.,"I was waiting patiently for this Amazon movie to be release since I love the book. The only thing that was in both was the title and John Kelly. The book was during the Vietnam War in the 1970s and this movie present day. It has a woman Seal commanding the Seal Team. Vietnam era helicopter the UH-1 ""Iroquois"" helicopter painted in gloss black was in one rescue operation. I think they went dirt cheap on this helicopter rental. Anyways it is a completely different story. More of a B revenge movie with action. Not a Tom Clancy story. Story did not seem believable to me either.",1.0,3950
nickg696, More wokeness.,After half a dozen movies and a TV series Hollywood ruins another franchise with forced wokeness. Just turning the white characters into a PoC and the strong male characters into unrealistic women. Why not an origin story of James Greer? He is black and male and a badass. Michael B. Jordan is a just ok actor not bad not great. I think he tends to over act. Willem Defoe was perfect as Clark. A mysterious CIA spook who bent the rules to complete covert objectives. In Jack Ryan the series it was Matice. Just keep it real for Gods sake!,2.0,3951
deepc185, Unwatchable garbage,I went into this knowing that it wasnt going to be just like the novel. I even accepted the fact that the bad guys probably wouldnt be drug dealers or the cartel. But what I couldnt have foreseen is how ridiculously unrealistic this would be!Considering how accurate Tom Clancys novels were its an insult to slap Clancys name on this hot mess! From simple uniform mistakes to ignoring that police dispatch would run the plates on a foreign diplomatic plates and allow their officers to pull over the vehicle and detain the occupants to the Hollywood staple of suppressors making firearms almost completely silent (even unsurpressed weapons were more quiet than a real suppressor would be) and many other ridiculous scenarios. Throw in the cheesy dialog and over dramatic acting and this movie seemed more like a satirical comedy minus the comedy than a realistic action movie.It would be more entertaining and productive to spend nearly 2 hours of your life rearranging the items in your pantry in numerical order by their UPC codes than wasting that time on this movie!,3.0,3952

dvalovich, You can skip this one without remorse,God awful. Clancy probably rolling over in his grave. The $2.5M he got in 1993 might soften the blow. Zero and I mean zero connection to the book. In their production meetings they must have said this is a terrible script- what can we do to save it? Lets just make John Kelly/Clark a black guy invent a niece for Admiral Greer- make her a co-star use the Clancy Name title and nothing else. The movie absolutely stinks. Rainbow 6 is going to be worse...but Ill never know because you couldnt force me to watch it. Michael Jordan had potential in the role- its not his fault movie is terrible- but he doesnt save it either. Id love to see how they explain Kelly/Clark working for the US Government in Rainbow 6 after they killed his pregnant wife in this one. I had a far better time reading the reviews and seeing how other people hated it too. Misery loves company I guess.,1.0,3955

The actors make unrealistic decisions at every turn (i.e. Highly trained navy seals on full alert that allow a guy to square up in the doorway of a hall and shhot an rpg at them. Sorry does not seem real. Adding a female special forces combat officer strectched it even more.So then we get to Tom Clancys ""Without Remorse"" the only thing the novel and this movie share is the name. I can look padt the obvious race of the main charscter but somehow he turned white in earlier (later) storylines. The plot was brought up to date instead of Kelly being a Vietnam operator. ok maybe I can look past that but the antagonist was totally changed from street drug gang to Russian special forces.

jhornsby912, Missed opportunity / Waste of MBJ,Michael B. Jordan gave an incredible performance capturing the quiet determination and commitment of Tom Clancys John Kelly. But the rest of this movie was a failure of imagination and a monument to formulaic cinema.The source novel takes place in the Vietnam War era so its understandable that they didnt want to make a straight translation of the book. But the storylines were still there for the taking - a Navy SEAL taking revenge on a drug trafficking network that caused his wifes death while hes also doing covert operations for the CIA and DOD in a war zone? What part of that couldnt have been made relevant for today?An even bigger travesty is the character development of John Kelly in this movie. In the the novel Kellys handlers are continually surprised and impressed by his analysis of the economics of the drug trade and interpersonal dynamics of the drug cartel hes trying to take down. Hes also adept with logistics and tactical strategy even improving on their mission plans in Vietnam. These traits are what make him so valuable to the CIA and eventually the obvious choice for heading up Rainbow. But in the movie Kelly is reduced to a killing machine who shows flashes of intelligence yet still manages to fall into just about every trap set for him. Too often MBJs Kelly has to fight his way out of a bad situation whereas Clancys Kelly was always one step ahead.The 4 stars here are for MBJ making the most of what he was given. Too bad the creative team didnt make the most of what they were given by Clancy and couldve been given by MBJ.,4.0,3989

allstarrunner, Without Excitement,"Just like the TV series based on Tom Clancy and distributed by Amazon Prime the writing is extremely bad with a ho-hum plot. Absolutely nothing new or even exciting to see here; if you were hoping for a Tom Clancy thriller cease to hope before watching.I am a huge fan of Taylor Sheriden who has written so many great things and I am so glad I didnt realize he wrote this until after I had already seen it otherwise my expectations would have been sky high. Never in my wildest imagination would I have guessed that he wrote this consider the entire time through the movie I kept thinking how god awful the writing and dialog was. The main character is constantly talking to the audience (through a side character) to make sure that we are ""caught up"" with what is going on over and over again but the dialog doesnt even hide it well.Overall even writing aside there just isnt a good movie here. Its very unfortunate what is happening and im not even sure I know what but I have no doubt this very low quality(plot wise not production value)/low suspense movie will be ""#1 on amazon Prime!"" and tons of people will watch it and it will justify this horrible cycle of producing crap films with bad writing and poor plots.

Other than the intentional deception to lure unexpecting viewers it might have merited an extra point just as a poor incongruent action movie. So far I think theres not one single Clancy ""based"" movie that deserves the signature.Without Remorse IMHO is the most engaging of Clancys novels. It would make great material for a 10 episode series and then a basis to keep on with the Ryan saga. Might make a terrific serialized program; one season per novel demanding that the producers kept in the true narrative of the novels; so much material there.Returning to the film it might entertain you; heavy action completely unbelievable.

And for most of that time Ive been waiting for someone to finally step up and adapt my favourite of all his novels Without Remorse. And Ive also been preparing myself to be disappointed. Good thing too. To be fair Jordan does a great job with what hes been given but hes not John T. Kelly. Dialogue is stodgy other characters are cardboard plot is ridiculous. Would it have been so wrong to stick with the book? Half revenge trip against drug dealers and pimps half Nam POW rescue mission? Does everything have to be dumbed down and made current?? Oh well.

The second half of the movie we just kept wondering how on earth anyone thought this garbage would make a movie. First of all while I could imagine a female in the role of Greer it would not be someone who looked like a Somali fashion model. Poor Jodie Turner-Smith doesnt have a voice that conveys anything at all. The sound is muffled and she drones on in a monotone.

Jodie Turner Smith is good the best this project has to offer but mainly shes wasted. Michael B. by the way he cant really act. Watching this sorry take on Tom Clancys work brings that fact home.

sithbunny, Wish they would keep things the same.,I lovedTom Clancy books and movies where awesome when I was growing up and I always wanted them to make Without Remorse into a movie the moment I finished the book. I was devastatingly disappointed. The only commonality are some of the characters and the title. Chang the character names and the title and not claim this to be a Tom Clancy movie and this would be an ok action movie. Either stick with the plot of the books and do them justice or dont claim to do a Tom Clancy film. The plot they did use was kinda borish and not what I would expect for a Tom Clancy release. It was more in the direct to DVD league. Or bargain bin movie at walmart.,3.0,4045
Tommetfactory28, A bad B-movie.,What this film does have and why it has any stars at all is some ok action some big name actors and having looked at MIchael B Jordan - a desire to get back to the gym. In essence though the film is awful. The story is horrible and non sensible. Its got such a basic premise that plays out like they were making it up as they went along. You just end up feeling numb to everything going on. The lead character is monotone and lifeless. Nothing is brought to the table in terms of characterisation. I hope whoever wrote this appalling script and story goes back to a dark room where they can quietly retire from making terrible movies!,2.0,4046

It has too many plot-holes to name but one horrible example occurs when the military/CIA continue a mission despite the key player literally saying he doesnt plan to follow orders. But with all of that the story beats the acting .Almost every component you would want create well in a film sucks in this movie.

yandards, Lazy - a terrible attempt to modernise a great novel,In an attempt to modernise a cold war era novel this has taken everything that was compelling about the book and dumped it. From blinding obvious stupid decisions to inconsistent abilities without even touching on terrible character motivation.A team of highly trained individuals that cant seem to hit a cows bum with a shovel at 2 paces in one scene lurches to 3 of the most accurate hand grenade throws from a rooftop in the next.What on earth would posses you to take of a parachute in a plane that was crashing is beyond me but it enabled a nice underwater sequence whilst trying to retrieve badly stowed equipment I guess.Whilst the character motivation to avenge his wifes death is a reasonable driving factor its not a touch on the original plot line in the novel.Clark was never written as a character who would feel like his country betrayed him in fact duty was one of his core beliefs driving him onward. This film subverts my expectations by flipping that on its head which while inline with modern Hollywood doesnt make it a good decision.If you havent read the book then this film is still bad the movement and weapons choreography of what is supposed to be a highly trained group is rubbish by modern standards - notably towards the end where they make their way down the stairs. Also not sure why a sniper cant hit a guy in the floor with about 15 shots but then takes out 2 Policemen in the same scene.,3.0,4053

blackknight-51234, Beyond disappointing - nothing new here.,"I was hoping for more so much more.Poorly conceived incredibly formulaic big government conspiracy nonsense. Theres nothing believable or new in the whole film. Clancys relatives must be short of money (or very greedy) to be associated with this.Michael B Jordan scowls his way through the film and the female SEAL team leader/exposition machine is as miscast an actor as youll see this year. Nearly all the other characters are cardboard cut outs and imminently forgettable.Several of the action sequences are shot in near darkness making it hard to see what is going on. This was further exacerbated by the fact I cared less and less as the film limped towards its staggeringly obvious conclusion.I spent the last 40 minutes looking at my phone waiting for the bad guy to be ""revealed"" and then die.None of the action is remotely credible hiding behind doorways to avoid a suicide vest driving off a bridge into water without injury etc etc.I can only assume the military consultant was the bloke from the local air soft range and the medical advisor does first aid courses out of the local travel lodge. Both areas are woefully inaccurate in almost every detail.If youre looking for excitement intrigue suspense or fresh ideas then youll not find any of that here.From the ending it appears that Amazon were planning this to be a franchise.

philipj980, Mediocre at best at worst well,Michael B Jordan Was just angry right from the start. There was just no need for his hostility right from the beginning this immediately took me out of the film. Straight up he was angry at the CIA guy ok right we see there is some foreshadowing kinda setting up plot points etc but why? So he didnt tell him they were selling arms they didnt tell them there were Russians there. Why would that matter he wouldnt have carried out his mission differently they still had a hostage to extract and they did it that might seem petty but like I said straight up I was rolling my eyes just lazy writingIt got worse from there just ridiculous plot point and fortuitous things happen so the movie could happen by the time he extracted a name from a dying Russian that was just so convenient I was pretty much laughing. So whats left the plot sucks how about the action it was ok but as I didnt care about any of the characters I didnt really care about what was happening just extended very long shootouts improbable action. The obligatory Very slim small no muscle woman beating a highly trained Russian spec ops guy in hand to hand. The completely useless Russian police who can only look up and miss a whole team walking out the front door right in front of them.. just pointless and boring.,3.0,4069

And its got ""Tom Clancy"" label on it so you can figure out the rest.Of course they have to inject a little unnecessary social justice scene that has little to do with the storyline. But Hollywood must believe that black characters need this anger to motivate them into violence and going above the law. So racist.Theres really not much here that one episode of SEAL Team doesnt routinely handle with better acting and writing. Its not unwatchable if you need a B-caliber action movie fix. But there are so many others that are much better. But rest assured its set up now for a string of equally cliched sequels.",3.0,4073

When the special effects dont cloud poor acting it sticks out like the proverbial.Plot what plot a theme or motive isnt a plot.As for the technical side of things well there isnt any.If Hollywood and the tech movie companies keep pushing out substance without style this medium will lose its charisma fast. Going on with low budget minimal characters or inane characterization together with slow and meandering plots gives way to watching grass growing as a better option.,1.0,4088

Morgan Freeman is tired.Directing : 15 different shots for 30 sec of dialogue wont make a movie better... quite the opposite.I had no sense of what was going on during the action scenes and everything was sooooo boring.Spoiler alert : The motorcycle disappearing instantly after sliding below the truck is so bad that it is hilarious...2/10.,2.0,4092

Then Ruby Rose shows up and it goes downhill from there.

Prismark10, Vanquish,Ruby Rose is an actress that divides opinion. She is openly gay and gender fluid which might have turned some people against her.After leaving Batwoman she is looking to become an action star.Vanquish is a low budget and low rent version of John Wick.Rose plays Victoria who was a former drug runner for the Russians. Now with a young daughter she has been going straight.Victoria works for a retired disabled cop Damon (Morgan Freeman) who was once feted as a hero.With a daughter that needs expensive medical surgery. All of a sudden Damon forces Victoria to carry out five pickups on one night.Some of these pickups are people connected to Victorias past and it quickly escalates into violence.Also Damon has been involved with some dirty cops. A far cry from his heroic reputation.The story makes no sense whatsoever. The action takes place in some nondescript American city with some random Germans and French hanging about.I had no idea what the deal was with the crooked cops and the pickups that Victoria was being forced to do. Although it became obvious that the people she was meeting had a vendetta against her.This is a low budget action movie. It looks cheap the action scenes are awful and poorly staged. It has this horrible green colour palette.I guess Morgan Freeman is now strolling the same road as Nicolas Cage and Bruce Willis. Straight to VOD.,2.0,4114

FixedYourEnding, Is it really that bad? yes it is!,"Ill be honest- I gave this movie a try because I heard this is the worst movie of 2021 and it did not disappoint in that department. I didnt think it an be that bad with an actor like Morgan Freeman in it and a decent budget but it is!I was never a Morgan Freeman fan for some reason his voice and acting style didnt resonate well with me at all however this has nothing to do with Mr. Freeman. The main problem with this movie is the horrible editing sound mixing and acting of all other actors. After you get passed that you can also see that the story is also weak and unbelievable but again it is a distant second to the atrocious movie making skills of whoever was involved in this dreck.Starting with a non-ending horribly edited beginning credits you are already starting questioning what you are going to see and it is not getting any better. The general story is about an underground crime network that has corrupt cops supporting it (nothing new really). I lasted about 30 minutes in when I had to turn it off. I dont understand how somebody will finish watching this ""creation"" unless they are being paid to do so. It looks like a pitch filmed on a mobile-phone shown before the actual movie is made just to show the concept to investors. Since nobody compensate me for my time I decided its enough for me to crown this as the ""worst movie of 2021"" (at least as of now) without needing to watch to thing to the end.Exact score: 22 / 100 due to it not being the worst movie ever but really there is not much going for it. I would imagine you will watch it only if you lost a best of some sorts.",2.0,4125

No one respects no one shooting for no reason no backstory for her brother no nothing.Rly I rarely consider a movie a waste of time but this one really is!I couldnt finish it.

The script was completely uninsteresting. Horrible audio editing and choice of music scene cuts were a disaster and what is up with the green and blue hues?Whoever put this together should stick to B-movies....sorry some B-movies were shot better than this.In summary what a disappointment. :(,1.0,4131
grabboid-44815, Eeeehhhh,I read the reviews and decided to watch this movie anyway. Well first i think that this movie looks and feels to be so low budget. I think its a complete rewrite because of the story line. Explanation: there are huge story lines missing. Example: the explanation of the dead brother of Ruby Roses character the story behind Morgan Freemans character what Ruby Roses character did with her brother to make her an enemy to all the crime bosses what illness her daughter has and how she met Morgan Freemans character. The actors seem to have not been interested the entire movie and Im sure it may be because the script they signed contracts for was completely different and possibly better than the pandemic rewrite. It just seems like a forced movie. Its like you came into the movie theater in the middle of the movie. With that said the videography is horrible the locations are cheap and you are left confused to why all of this even started or happened. I think the actors and actresses did their best with what was given but the delivery of their lines makes you think that they didnt want to do the movie. Especially Morgan Freemans character. The action scenes are just 30 different angles switched back and forth the outdoor scenes are fake and cheap. The indooor shots seem as if they are sneaking and secretly trying to shoot a movie. Ruby Roses shooting scenes are so fake and the bike riding scenes are obviously green screen backgrounds for most of it. The bike chasing scenes arent edited so you can see that she isnt riding fast at all. The scenes where she gets shot at on her bike are not edited so it looks as though they are purposely shooting at objects beside her. Her evasive riding is delayed and makes the chase/shooting scene look even worse. Really the entire movie seems unedited. Its horrible. I just had to see it for myself. Be aware though there are B movies and then two letters below that is this movie.,3.0,4132
carolsparks-43587," Bad acting, boring","Surprisingly poor acting by all players including Morgan Freeman. Ruby Rose is so hard looking its difficult to watch.

For some reason they seem to be trying to make movies where thr female is an all round badass and its all nonsense. No one believes it and this particular female actress can NOT pull off this roll. She is as weak as they come and would be crushed by anyone older than 7.Trying to convince the world females are just like men is not going to work beucse they are not. They are always victims never heros a d its because thats the way feminists have made it saying females always get attacked.This movie is garbage and the lead actress is terrible - how has she even got a job in this business - how many (insert rude word) did she have to gobble to become an actress as she is one of the worst I have ever seen.She should take a leaf out of Jennifer garners handbook because she managed very successfully to pull of a badass role in Peppermint.

The set design is excellent and along with cold emotionless expressions on the actors and shots of the mundane lives of the would-be colonists helps to establish a plausible set-up with tons of potential. They know theyre the first generation of a ship on a multi-generational voyage to colonize another planet and may also be humanitys last hope of survival. Their grim personas express their awareness of this fact and that the mission is paramount. Theres even a mysterious hint at an unexpected presence on the ship to add to the suspense.Dont bother watching the second half though. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned it tries to adapt a plot similar to Lord of the Flies however the big difference here is that these teenagers are supposed to have been highly trained for this mission their entire lives and are literally the future of humanity. Theyre not a ragtag group of students on a deserted island struggling for survival.I dont think I need to use any spoilers for you to imagine how trying to shoehorn the Lord of the Flies plot into this situation leads to a trainwreck of a last half. The script takes a sharp turn into utter nonsense with ridiculous dialogue and characters actions. It is truly such a pity and a waste of a great set-up.I will say that I was impressed with the performance of Tye Sheridan in particular and Colin Farrell can rarely do wrong as well. The other main actors were decent at best or just too weighed down by atrocious dialogue to make anything of their performances.Id recommend watching the first 40min or so (8/10) and then just walking away and imagining your own conclusion. Anything would be better than what transpired in the last half of Voyagers.,4.0,4169
mvezok, I loved it,Proper mainstream SCIENCE Fiction without mysticism or quasi-intellectualism.Made me think about the state of the world and the democracy.And the excitement built up as it should in a good story till the very end.

nincubura, All Fi no Sci.,The writers cannot conceive that the best and brightest of Earths future would be well educated in the science of psychology and emotional intelligence -- precicely because they have NONE!

bwc-maneke, Lord of the Flies with a twist,"The Twist is its in Space and just gets stupid after that.These ""Characters"" are bad joke everything about this wreaks of bad writing and is utterly taboo. I was hoping the entire time of an actual alien or atleast a simulation hell I would have settled for a fake ship inside a NASA Vacuum Tube in a study to test the human mind when exposed to deep space and isolation.Instead its stupidity followed by even dumber dialog!

amycarender," Boring, disconnected, and irrational.",This went off the rails pretty quickly. Definitely written as if someone with no knowledge of any sciences outside of what they see on TV was trying to plan an essential mission to another planet - so its a mess. A lot of it doesnt make sense but I get told to just pretend it away so I tried that...And its still a nonsensical mess made up of a bunch of (apparently) the worlds most sociopathic teenagers most of whom have no sense of self-preservation whatsoever and a couple of Spock types who sort-of-kind-of try a little bit. But they still act like they didnt spend their entire existence training for EXACTLY THIS.None of these kids has any desire to live past tomorrow? Youre going to try to convince me that the majority of humans honest natures are irreparably evil and excited to die (because we dont come pre-programmed with the innate desire to procreate and continue surviving in their reality)? Even the imagery used as now-adult kids are experiencing emotions for the first time feels hollow like a failed attempt at mimicry. A bad impression of emotion and sensation. Someone making this movie had a deep misconception of sociology and psychology along with physics and astronomy.I can ignore some annoying science misconceptions but the idea that the majority of humans are in their truest selves absolutely selfish self-centered ignorant lust-driven murderous and purely evil gets ridiculously extreme. I could get behind a little stupidity but this much of it is just chaotic to the point that its boring. Like watching a room full of nap-less toddlers play Space Force.Just be ready for everything to go downhill as soon as Colin Farrells character is gone. Somehow the person who spends the smallest portion of their life on this mission is the one with the most character development. His character is the only one thats easy to identify with although Lily Rose Depp is a slightly robotic close second. At least thats who her character is supposed to be.Fionn Whitehead isnt very exciting in his antagonist role. He feels like a 13-year-old trying to play sociopath like he may not have studied this role and instead chose just to do Manson-eyes at the camera really badly. Hes a terrible villain.All in all the only person associated with this movie that I could believe is a sociopath is the writer. And maybe whoever else is in charge that made the decision that this would either make sense or be a good movie.,3.0,4175

sme3, Lord of the Flies in Space,There are many interesting ideas floating about in VOYAGERS but many clearly are borrowed from THE LORD OF THE FLIES. The attractive-young-people-learning-about-sex material feels lifted from films like THE BLUE LAGOON. The cast is convincing in their roles and the production design is good. Although there is some novelty with the science-fiction setting the overall familiarity of the material undercuts the quality of the production. The ending feels like an afterthought.,8.0,4197

taylorhayzlett, It was okay,I first found out about Voyagers after Lily-Rose posted something on Instagram promoting it. I thought it looked interesting and had a cool trailer. Not to mention a topic that had lots of potential. I rented it today not really expecting anything because of all of the bad reviews I had seen about it before. I went in thinking the acting would be bad the writing would be mediocre and it would just be an okay movie. After watching it I can tell you that it wasnt that bad. The acting was actually fine considering that all of the kids are supposed to have no personalities. The writing is where my issue is. This is a great concept for a movie but it was executed poorly. Richard was killed off much too early and I feel like he wasnt very necessary to the plot. All of the characters made stupid decisions from there on out. I think the probably with the movie is the character of Zac. He became a creep almost immediately after stopping The Blue. He resorted to inappropriately touching the women in the ship without consent. I know that theyve never known anything like this before but all of these kids are supposed to be extremely intelligent. I feel like they might know right from wrong. Also I find it hard to believe that once everyone was off the drug that they all either turned to partying or fighting. I think thats a stupid stereotype put onto teenagers in pop culture. I also think its weird that everyone on the ship would mindlessly follow Zac down his hole of madness and his random killing spree where he restored to shooting everyone who didnt agree with him. Overall this movie is fine. I think I would recommend it but its not my favorite.,4.0,4200

Listening to the pathetic dialogue and bickering of these teens made me feel like my ears are bleeding.

sinischism, Two words - DUMB & INSULTING,Just some quick background for you all in that I usually try not to beat up on movies despite the fact they may not meet my expectations (as that would entail probably sitting here on this site 24/7 writing about the myriad of dozens up on dozens of disappointing efforts over the years)Im a HUGE sci-fi fan and of course also love other genres as well just to give you some background.To that end I recently checked this film out as it seemed like an interesting premise. And frankly it was. The first half of the movie was well done and fairly realistic. Unfortunately (and here is where we have a bit of a spoiler alert) once the antagonist (and his soon to be brain-dead sheep followers) was fully infused with hyper-testosterone by not taking the specific protocol of medication required for all of the crew members the film went straight into the garbage bin for me.I mean did the director really think that teenagers are so completely stupid that they would believe an alien was involved in the death of the adult/supervising character (Colin Farrell) especially after they saw for themselves the actual video of him (the aforementioned antagonist) showing that he was the one who in fact killed the Farrell character?I just shook my head as things continued to spiral out of control into complete nonsense (and no as some have alluded to this was NO Lord of the Flies meets Space - Lord of the Flies was an excellent character study and a fine novel but this film was a pathetic and disgraceful attempt to try and seemingly mimic some of the dynamics of said novel and it failed miserably to do so)Its really too bad as I indicated the premise was interesting and the first half was quite good. Yet the last part of the film was a hot-mess of teen-angst meets out of control hormone self-indulgence.All I have to say is STAY AWAY from this piece of ludicrous garbage and check out so many other very fine sci-fi/space flicks that are out there - contact me if you would like a list.Cheers.,3.0,4214

drnursekellyann, Plot hole city,Such a sad state for us cinema-lovers. But Ill take what I can get I guess. This movie borrows so heavily from Lord of the Flies that it might consider being renamed Co-ed Lord of the Flies in Space. There was one injured adult and when he was dead the smoldering silent and sensitive protagonist continued to try and maintain order until the power hungry jerk took the conch shell from him. And the young lady who represented the role formerly known as Piggy met a similar demise when she kept nagging everyone to stop misbehaving. Highly unoriginal. I guess there really are only about 6 or 7 story lines in cinema that just keep recycling over and over... Otherwise from the beginning the Voyagers story is too big and ambitious and thus cannot make sense of all the questions that a story like this arises. Like who the hell would ever consider sending kids into space without a team of adult mentors to guide them? And not just one lonely Colin Farrell. Who still looks HOT as heck btw. And why do they keep saying the first generation wont live to see the new planet when the trip is only 80 years and the kids are only 8 years old when they start out? And why is Brann Stark reprising his role as the 3-eyed Raven in this movie? On the plus side Lily- Rose Depp is adorable and she and Tye Sheridan had chemistry.,4.0,4226

ed-503-465183, It just didn't deliver on a great premise.,Hard science fiction fans definitely wont like it.While this film wasnt a dystopian young adult film it had elements of that genre. If you like that kind of movie MAYBE (big maybe) this is for you but it really doesnt even deliver that well. There are much better films that play with these themes than Voyager.Frankly it was pretty lite on everything. Beyond the initial premise of what might happen on a long-term colonization spaceflight to an exoplanet this film really didnt offer much. It wasnt particularly thought-provoking fun action-packed suspenseful dramatic nor did it play with any new ideas. It was completely formulaic and predictable.While not hard science fiction the movie Passengers was a more entertaining and better-looking interstellar trip than Voyagers. Both films have kind of similar endings as well.This one had me bored by the beginning of the second act and the third act was just meh.

WalkdenEntertainment, Earth Has A Big Problem...,The future is here. Earth has a significant problem as it continues to heat up more and more making it an unliveable planet. The only way the people of Earth can get by is to investigate and find a new home.Thirty young men and women are selected for a critical mission. The selection includes some of the finest young people of Earth who are well educated and healthy. Leading the mission is Richard (Colin Farrell) who is quite passionate to support the crew as much as possible. To the young people he is a teacher counsellor and a general close friend. The mission will take over eighty years which means the young people selected will never get to see their new home but their purpose is to create new life once they are the appropriate age and then the next generation will save the entire world.The mission is in progress but Christopher (Tye Sheridan) & Zac (Fionn Whitehead) begin to question a few elements on the ship. They examine a blue liquid that they must drink daily and wonder why certain areas on the ship are hidden. What starts as a minor act of rebellion becomes a path of madness and paranoia not just for Christopher and Zac but for the entire onboard crew. They also begin to question each other on topics such as leadership affections and trust. To make matters worse the team are also on edge as they learn there could be the threat of an alien creature on the ship. Can the mission be completed to save Earth? Will members of the ship survive the chaos?Visually I found Voyagers to be rather pleasing. The world of outer space and future technology concepts on the ship were rather creative and great to see and elements such as the sound effects were also outstanding. As a plot Voyagers has a slow start. Once we see the ship members begin to raise questions and take risks I was generally curious to know what will happen next. I was also questioning if the ship did really have an alien creature on board.But sadly Voyagers is not a simple watch. While Voyagers delivers a pleasing world of space and sci-fi the films plot is quite messy. We witness characters doing repeated things: questioning the truth arguing over leadership exhibiting trust issues and seeing teenagers discover their emotions and sexual feelings for the first time. While such discovery seems like an interesting concept for the first time the film reveals these aspects in a repetitive confusing manner. It is also frustrating watching these so-called intelligent youth make continually unwise choices.The film is also entirely predictable contains cheesy performances and there are some moments that I generally found awkward to watch. Watching a teenager touch a young girl without her permission for the first time with no real consequences even from an adult figure was extremely disappointing to see. Make note; this is not the type of film to share on a first date.The editing here is also questionable. There are moments where characters discuss an issue or have conflict only to get distracted by another issue that is occurring elsewhere and the dispute is suddenly ignored. The film does not flow well and scenes feel disjointed failing to bring continuous flow to the story. After the film I questioned if many cuts and edits were made for the sake of the films runtime. For the most part performances were fine but by the third act characters become more laughable than serious as they deliver lines that are just unfitting cheesy and over the top.Overall while I enjoy the concept of a group of youth travelling to a new planet to save the world and visually Voyagers has a few genuinely pleasing aspects as a sci-fi movie it is messy and awkward. The editing is questionable making scenes feel more disjointed rather than seamless. The film is also incredibly predictable regarding its mysteries. The plot elements feel repetitive as we watch the ships crew bicker and argue over the same topic repeatedly to the point the film becomes laughable instead of something more exciting and memorable. Voyagers felt as though it was aimed at a more teenage audience.4.7/10 - Walkden Entertainment.,5.0,4239
tnovak-86787, A quickly moving experience,Depicting a space odyssey in just over an hour is going to be a challenge; not everyone can amass a budget like Stanley Kubrick so I temper my expectations before blast off. I was impressed positively with all things physical - solid believable sets and costumes and with crisp graphics provide an effective space vehicle. I cannot say Ive ever imagined what a trip to our new planet will be like or who will go - with a phenomenal videographic sequence depicting 9 months in seconds then we know: those that know nothing of life on this planet. That was an unexpected premise; but what happens next as they develop? The writers decided to cart way back on the trip and offer a shallower wide angle study of the group dynamic versus detailed character studies or engineering functions. Human nature cannot be deterred it posits wisely; the id and ego emerge hormones flow and so that goes. To generate conflict superstition is introduced as a boogie man and bad things happen; corny as it usually is many believe. There are a few thrilling sequences predictable but with a payoff. Scripting had to meet the writers demands it seems and is mostly sparse and punctual. Performances by the leads I felt are more than adequate as they did their jobs. The film is like a detailed Da Vinci painting though not as valuable - we can zoom in on details in various areas of the story but when we stand back and take in the whole the details fade and we appreciate the larger more important story. It turns out we will keep on punching each other in the nose on the way but well get there.,6.0,4240
godosenteksist, Great depiction of the human species.,Most reviews here are tragic saying this isnt what would happen and the best of humans would know better than this going out in space. Well if that movie was made of a crew that was sent out on a 86 year trip and everything was fine and dandy what kind of entertainment would that be? Instead this movie is smart about showing the very core of human nature as its being introduced in the later development of the young adult mind. Do people reviewing this movie have any clue or evidence of this experiment on humans? No one has because its a SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE idea.Even though every part of this movie is a cliche it still delivers the message of our faults. How just one bad seed can spread fear and devastation how peer pressure works common enemy strategy and all other aspects of how every dictator has used their manipulation to drive their hate through people. If this isnt a perfect example of entertainment AND education then what is?The cast is amazing and deliver such a performance of how it feels to go through existential crisis and experience revelations of a wider knowledge than the small world theyve grown to know. Acting is in the eyes not in the words.Anyone who says this movie is dumb or unrealistic do so because they didnt understand it. Its like when someone says they understand how a car works because they can check the oil level themselves then when asked to explain how the engine works they resort to name calling and how dumb it is to cover up they have no idea. Well the more you learn about a car engine the more you realize how little you actually knew from the beginning.,9.0,4241
calvinharrisq, Should be given 0,Honestly thought this was a good sex movie or just plain junk. It was disappointing overall. I mean theres no motive for this experiment thing in space. They Have only one man as their moderator and they were ignorant kids except one guy who created the villain. Lilly Rose depp was ugly without make-up and not much of an actress. There was much better people than her in that cast Who should Have done the lead role. Will not recommend this. Complete waste of time.,1.0,4242
gkukumakov, Why is that hate?,I really enjoyed the movie. I dont get all the bad reviews here...,10.0,4243
mourmouka," Well, that was a REALLY bad idea.",Imagine the future of all humanity is on the hands of a bunch of teenagers. I mean what could go wrong! In Lord of the flies the isolation that leads to chaos and murder happens by accident. This movie actually claims that the most brilliant minds of our planet would come up with an idea like this to save our species! At least the acting and the setting was decent.,5.0,4244
martgym, Sci and a little fi,Its just a futuristic space set Lord of the Flies.,7.0,4245
BRamsey1776," Actually it DOES make sense, here's why (but movie still is only average)",All these low score reviewers who are saying this would never happen are mistaken. Youve got to remember everyone sent out were KIDS and not only that but kids who were raised in extreme sterile isolation AND drugged to be docile from childhood on. Theres absolutely no telling how they might go Lord of the Flies crazy after quitting the controlling drugs and dealing with hormones and everything else for the first time ever with almost NO ADULTS around to stabilize society. So how they act in the second half of the movie MIGHT be realistic who can really say. Whats completely bullcrap fake idiotic is that such a mission would occur in the first place. No government would send out a big batch of kids on a mission to save humanity. There would be loads of adults. There are PLENTY of smart well adjusted adults who would give up the rest of their lives on such an important mission.,6.0,4246
matthewmatt-18606, Pretty good,I love Sci-Fi so I will watch a ton of garbage to get to something decent.and this was DECENT. It does turn into Lord of the Flies more or less . But how could it not to a certain degree?.People are flawed and have the ability to be self centered so it is a strong possibility that the situation would occur in the premise of going to a far off world that is going to take 100 yrs to get to.The acting characters and the ship especially was done well so I can say that I would recommend it especially if you have modest expectations.,5.0,4247
MrSpark, Lord of the flies meets Alien,An interesting concept that could have gone completely different from what was expected. The movie is interesting to watch albeit it has its cheesy moments and is a complete rip-off of the classic Lord of the flies.First of all the acting is pretty good it has some emotionless moments that could have used some beefing up however. It was all to drive the plot around the lord of the flies copying.Secondly cinematographically speaking it delivers a nice claustrophobic feel similar to the film Alien the music also reminds some of it. Especially during the credits.Lastly I would like to point out its basically lord of the flies in space the characters are even the same  they even have a dedicated Piggy character. But lo and behold the twist it has an ending exactly like Alien they blast the bad guy (who also could be the metaphorical Alien in the film) out of the spaceship.Apart from that it can fill the void you might be having on a Sunday night.,5.0,4248

akira-hideyo, Spoilt brats in space,Gave a 5 for visuals. The rest is a yawn. Illogical bunch of rogue young test tubed space punks minus the few obvious do gooders that saved the day on a mission to be mankinds future civilization on another planet. A story maze if youre looking to burn off close to 2 hours of idle time.,5.0,4250
john_constantine, My brain hurts so bad,"So this movie features a bunch of teenagers in space in probably the most idiotic nonsensical way to set up a generation ship. The writing is just so bad it makes my brain hurt. The producers probably have taken too much of the blue themselves and then barfed out this disaster of a movie. Its like you eat and barf out Lord of the Flies ten times and then send the vomit out to space. Just watch your washing machine for two hours to get more entertainment. Skip watching Voyagers and watch the 2014 miniseries ""Ascension"" instead.",1.0,4251

doanviettrung, Basically a mutiny on a (space)ship,And the mutiny is started by a guy using disinformation. The majority on board follow his blatant disinformation even though they are supposed to be smart.One user reviewer said the start was slow. It doesnt seem like that to me. The plot got straight to the point from the first minute and it didnt even develop the main characters from their childhood.,6.0,4256
vovers1, Over simplified but you get the SciFi,Dont believe the haters this movie does deliver a punch with a rapid societal degeneration created by controlling humans. The decision to finish the movie with a cute apple pie ending is a pity and lacking in imagination. Overall a solid scifi both technically and socially could have been so much more. But what was delivered was entertaining if not though provoking.,6.0,4257
CommandoPenguins, 'Voyagers' brings out the worst in Humanity and threats facing future colonists,The voyagers a group of lab-grown teenagers raised on a spaceship en route to colonize and repopulate a distant exoplanet with habitable conditions soon takes a darker turn when a few overly hormonal teenagers let their hedonistic fantasies run wild. The themes on humanity at its worst self is emphasized throughout the film but the execution is too clumsy for it to make much of an emotional impact. It just goes to show that we dont need alien intruders crashing asteroids or severe malfunctions in the spaceship to threaten the mission when the worst of human nature can cause a much bigger problem.We also witness the kindness of compassionate and sympathetic characters like Sela (Lily-Rose Depp) that balances out the movies equilibrium to an extent.Think it has more to do with the outlook on humanitys worst self more than the spectacle of showing breathtaking views of space and distant exoplanets. Apart from Lily Rose Depps character everyone else turned out violent rapey and (very cliched) toxic males fighting over who gets to claim the girl. Intriguing premise somewhat let down by bad editing subpar acting and lacking special effects.,4.0,4258
perpinias, Very good movie,Better than my expectations. Not just an adolescent sci-fi movie more like a philosophical/sociological one. One may say that it describes the very begining and the dawn of humanity and civilization as we know it. I enjoy it very much. It has a lot to say for our nature.,9.0,4259
MrMcArony, Intelligent sci-fi,As already stated a hundred times here its Lord of the Flies in space but presents many more interesting moral questions and without the familiar Hollywood bombast. It may actually be closer to A Clockwork Orange in terms of its philosophical dilemma and it had me rivetted to my seat throughout. In short the most enjoyable sci-fi film Ive seen since Arrival.,9.0,4260
smartypantsz," Ernest, Exciting, Quiet Social Drama Set In Space","I like Sci-Fi movies plain and simple. Im always waiting for the next great Sci-Fi movie especially if it involves the future space travel and the human race (ala Passengers). This film hit all the right spots for me so I was excited to watch it.Generally I dont read reviews before I watch a film. I like to take it in on my own without any prejudice pushed at me by others. After watching it I came to IMDb - and I could tell there would be hate gushing forth (I still havent read the bad reviews... I just just hear it: ""boring"" ""Slow paced"" ""No action"" blah blah blah. I dont get it. O.k. - its not an Oscar contender but it kept my interest there was genuine drama the young actors did a really excellent job I thought (Colin Farrell was great as usual) and the social aspect of the plot pulled me in and made me really want to see how this was going to play out.All-in-all Id say if you like thoughtful tense Sci-Fi set in the future - in outer space with some great new acting faces doing great jobs (very diverse btw) - youre going to like this.",8.0,4261
markthomassintek, Lord of the flies in space,REVIEW - VOYAGERSRelease date 2 July 2021WOW!At school I read a book called The Lord of the Flies where a group of children get deserted on an island during which they form their own 2 separate communities.This essentially is a lord of the flies but set in space and very well made too.A group of children are artificially born to pilot a space craft to a new Earth so all the children have been brought up the sane with no interaction with the outside world.What happens is basically an excellent exploration of human nature and the argument of nature vs nurture.Excellent film definitely one for your list with a great story acting and which may make you question why we do what we do to each other.Rating 9 out of 10.,9.0,4262
bigBang8, In reality would probably end in...,...mIssion fail. They live most of their lives doped then get off it and rush of emotions completely tilt everyone. You have a character try to be alpha who promises protection and food when really its all for his own gain and the rest cave in to peer pressure like fools showing every negative trait were capable of. Thats my only gripe. Could have made it more interesting by having a psycho on board caused by the drug perhaps.Most of the reviews are about expecting something supernatural/aliens or a twist that its all a simulation and vote it low but in a real situation this is the most likely outcome as far as what could go bad bar some catastrophic ship failure/collision. On an important trip like this there would be numerous safeguards against going off protocol. They wouldnt be able to go off the blue first of all. But that makes for an incredibly uneventful and dull movie. Its aimed at younger audiences by the looks so its not meant to inspire existential crisis that most people seek from entertainment mediums.,9.0,4263
nioakeim, the epitome of human nature,I really liked this movie. Its the epitome of human nature. All these events that characterise the human kind especially the ones that terrorism and superstition is used to control and manipulate people.Yes this movie may be similar to the Lord of the Flies so what?I feel the message it carries is current and relevant repacked in a space setting with fresh characters that young people can relate to and maybe get the message that only with peace and collaboration we can move forward and continue to exist.I recommend it.,8.0,4264
valentin_sieben, an ok movie,A teens generation is sent through space to another habitable planet. The seems to be exciting only when the first - out of three gren. - generation remains alone without the chief an older man. One of them is instable an others just fallow suit.

ricardomartins_thesecond, Unfortunate,"This is a movie that treats teenagers like extreme idiots plain and simple. Its unfortunate that there wasnt a deeper character development (there was none) and just plainly stated ""teens are dumb so this all happens"".

It took a interesting topic and reduced the characters to characterizations.",5.0,4268

ravencorinncarluk, Nic Cage dialed to 11,I LOVED this movie. Just cheesey and gory and funny and campy and pure enjoyment.Ive watched enough lets plays of Five Nights At Freddys to have recognized the plot just from the description so I was expecting Nic Cage to chew on the scenery of gore and jump scares. I would have been fine with something a little lame but with that certain Cage flair.Instead I got something surprisingly good. The cinematography was balanced with little bits of surreal and fun angles but never so much to become distracting. Good color scheme and lighting and the creature design really captured that slightly terrifying look of way-back-when Chuck E Cheese.I enjoyed how the script was full of tropes but the actors carried it well and everything came across well. Almost like everyone was having fun wanted the audience to enjoy themselves but they took it just serious enough to deliver good performances.The whole movie is right on that edge of camp and parody without necessarily being played for laughs like a comedy. Something more like Evil Dead 2 or Kung Fury; love and enjoyment of the genres without mockery.That being said this is NOT a horror or even really a thriller. It gets those labels because it needs some kind of genre but it really fits in its own little niche and it will NOT be for everyone. But as a popcorn/drinking-with-friends movie it really hits the spot.And I cannot understate how much Nic Cage was absolutely himself dialed to 11. Sold every scene and stole most of them. All without a single line of dialogue. That really was the cherry on top and I gave an extra star and a half for his performance.,9.0,4278
aymenlord, 2 Words.,If you watch movies to actually enjoy your time then go for it if you are some sick perfectionist (like most of the 1/10 raters here) whos expecting every movie to be of Nolans plot actors and script then this is not a movie for you nor a place for you to downrate such an entertaining product.,9.0,4279
daymonperry, Maybe a B Cult Film? Is that even possible?,I guess the 5.5/10 agreggate is a thing but comments from mostly youngsters love the movie and are already demanding a sequel.I knew Nic had adoring fans at one time I read several comments from feminine monikers that maybe he still does.I watched it once I started it. I cant even explain it. Inane chaos maybe. But I do love it when a deal that is shook on is honored and finalized as agreed to the end.Maybe a couple modern spaghetti dramas and 70s/80s movies collided.Anyway dont want to be masculine toxic but a beautiful girl is always a treat for me Emily Tosta I think from Mayans.Beautiful women can absolutely hang around the finish line and go home with the winner (Nic in this case) as far as Im concerned.Shows Nics range very well (I stole that from a comment so dont blame me).They afforded the license to play Free Bird? Okay! Shoot what a few thousand anyway if not more.I.... like it. ~67 out of 100.,7.0,4280
jarojas-78750, Solid C+ Horror/ Action Movie,Obviously this movies not going to win awards which wasnt its intention. Its an entertaining fun flick with loads of plot holes things that make you question the characters and Nic Cage not saying one word. All in all its worth the 3.99 rental off Prime but I definitely wouldnt put more than that.,6.0,4281
Dark_Lord_Mark," Nic Cage Rocks in a Zany, Over The Top, Action, Horror, Murder Fest; Willy's Wonderand!",Nic Cage is one of the only top list actors who can carry a movie with his pure acting skills.In Willys Wonderland Nic Cage doesnt say one word yet he is the star and carries this fun over the top action movie full of thrills and amazing premise and similar over the top sound track.Nic Cage is the action hero who ends up saving the town and maybe the world from murderous possessed cyber animatronic robots. Yeah I actually wrote that and darn proud.The movie is 10 out of a 10 for fun and similarly the soundtrack and cinematography was just as top notch.Movie is worth the watch and highly recommended. Most fun movie since 2021 and poised to be a cult favorite. 10 out of 10!,10.0,4282

bradaviel," No words, only Punchy Cage",What happens when you drop a** kickin Nicolas Cage in a Feebles/Killer Klowns universe ? Exactly what youd expect. No words no explanation to his character except punches kicks and final blows Cage is at his best doing exactly what you love to see him do. While hes known for award winning and AAA blockbuster performances I always enjoy seeing him in projects no one but him would accept and pull to their best potential. In recent years Mom and Dad Mandy & Color out of space really gained points with his mere presence and boy does he shine when hes having fun. On par with those this is a refreshing flick and Im really hoping we keep seeing more pop up from time to time. And while many horror and indie flicks get forgotten over the years this one will be remembered by everyone who gave a chance to the experience.,7.0,4284
arjuun-30058, its just like the trailers promise,If you are wanting a over the top action horror biased off of video games like 5 night at Freddies then this is the movie for you. The whole movie is overall fun and doesnt need much thought its easily put together and is well filmed . The acting wasnt bad the cg was old and needed some help but still fun. while not a perfect movie it was a fun hour and half . if your into over the top movies that pile on the goofy crazy tropes then this will be for you,7.0,4285

Take a puff and pour some whiskey because the greatness is about to begin.,10.0,4286
fayeistooldforthis, The animatronics are better actors than most of the cast.,The dialogue is so bad Nicholas Cage decides to spend the entire movie glaring into the camera rather than speak a word of it. The poor guy just wants to clean the set and get this movie over with as soon as possible but the other actors keep getting in his way. Fortunately he has a ready supply of bin bags...This film would have been far better if you literally stripped out every scene that didnt involve Nicholas Cage.,3.0,4287
aldridgetim, Soon to be cult classic you need to see in theaters!!!,This is complete trash that is a steaming pile that oozes a role written for Nick Cage.

phildeesnow, Aging with dignity,The movie was a lot of fun and chuckles. But i want to highlight Nicolas Cage since the moment he became a Meme it probably was hard for him but he reinvented himself in this crazy character that let us satisfy and wanting more in the latest movies. He is funny he is cool he is THE MAN and still he is Nicolas Cage and we love him. I think he was the first one not taking himself too serious and not inspire pity like Stallone... or Schwarzenegger and make us feel old. Nick can still do it and even if it is for laugh i end up not regretting my age. Thanks Nick!.,10.0,4291

johan-pa-persson, Had potential But fall flat,I love Nicholas Cage and when i saw the trailer i was very hyped. It looked both fun and enjoying. Cage is the best in the whole movie. He doing good What he has to work with. But the story was lacking in a bunch of places . Yes i know u shouldnt except to much logic reason and explonation in this kind of movies . But some scenens and acting was very bad from the rest of the charatchers. One thing was Never explainedThe thing that Cage had to take breaks when his clock biped spoiler( he just leave a girl who is about to get attacked just to play a flipper game).This could Have been an over the Top really fun horrorcomedy But the horror and comedy Didnt work in many places. The plot of the backstory was also poorly made.Sure the movie had some fun moments. Making cage dont say anything was ok But i think it would help the movie if cages had said some fun oneliners.So an good movie if u drunk or are with a group off friends maybe But nothing u Would watch sober and alone,5.0,4301

Basically you´ll see a completely mute Cage fighting demonic muppets playing pinball and drinking purple pops. That´s the movie. A secondary cast so bad your theet will hurt.

Even someone saying there was a myth about some guy that came from hell to take them back... SOMETHING... But they tell you nothing about why he is... or why he does what he does... Which he has some idiosyncratic tendencies that are NOT best left unexplained... But they do leave them unexplained.

contegolibertas-40221, Exactly as the Trailer promises: New Type of Genre?,If you loved the trailer youll get what you wanted.Its a higher end B-Movie in the vein of good B-Movies like Evil Dead 2 and is just a joy ride.This isnt a masterpiece but high marks for possibly creating a new kind of genre.It has troupes galore it keeps itself from becoming campy is kinda hazy in the serious department but is saved by everyone giving an honest performance when opportunity for hammy it up was ripe.Theres a little mix up in some of the artsy cinematography. From a B-movie its the main thing that keeps it from reaching masterpiece B-Movie territory. Theres many other things to nitpick and with some better acting here better dialogue there and a more cohesive alignment with various things....could have launched it to the stratosphere.Point being. This is great for what it is. Overall this is something. Refreshing and possibly new.Nic Cage has been kicking out tons of junk movies for years now. But about once a year hes in a Diamond of a movie. Zero lines? He pulls it off. Its his 2021 diamond.,9.0,4310
ajcharding, Dumbest movie ever,I went into this movie knowing that it would be silly. Little did I know how utterly stupid that this movie would actually be. I feel like I want Nic Cage to pay me back for the money that I paid to rent this movie and also pay me for my time wasted watching this movie. Kung Pow! Enter The Fist used to be the number 1 worst movie that I had ever seen. This just took it to a whole new level and blew that one out of the number 1 spot. Terrible terrible terrible movie!!!,1.0,4311
mgtrock, Awesome!,This film is not a star studded Oscar biopic but good films dont need to be!It has a simple plot that is carried out well and Cage delivers without uttering a single word throughout the whole film and without going completely off the wall Im not a massive fan when goes full Cage and he hit the sweet spot in this.The effects are good the colour visuals are good the soundtrack is great and youll be singing the creepy signature song for a long time.The film has the feel of many genres a bit of grindhouse a bit of b movie a bit of western a bit of horror etcI hope this is an upward direction for the director and not his peak as Id like to see more at this level from him,8.0,4312

eggrolljr, Don't believe the positive reviews,"This is not Nicholas Cage ""dialed up to 11""  this is Nicholas Cage sleep walking for a pay check in a very low budget film that doesnt exhibit a single creative moment in the entirety of its run time. This has to be Cage at his least interesting and that is entirely the fault of the non-existent script and uninspired filmmakers. If you want to see Cage delivering a gonzo performance in a fun film this absolutely is not that.Each animatronic is defeated easily with a few whacks from... a stick. Do not waste your time or your brain cells.",3.0,4314
On_The_Mark, Painfully awful on numerous levels,"Nicholas Cage is a mute who is 60 but pretending to be 30 with his died black goatee and (usual) bad wig. He gets locked in a ""Chuck E Cheese"" type building and ""fights robot characters. Its so absurd and boring at the same time. Hes cleaning the place a character comes alive he fights it then goes back to cleaning like this is an every day occurrence. Repeat this over and over.Once the cliched group of high school kids arrived I had to stop it was unwatchable. It wasnt funny it wasnt entertaining. It was beyond stupid.

They didnt build up any suspense for the animatronics I dont think there was a single shot that they didnt look like dudes in costumes. I have no idea why Nicholas Cage had no reaction to what was going on. He didnt even flinch when he started getting attacked by fluffy robots it was just a thing that was happening. For a movie with such a cool concept there was zero style zero flair and the most mundane action scenes Ive ever seen.,1.0,4317

BeerLover_, Nah,"After Mandy and Color Out of Space I was expecting another b-movie gem starring Nicholas Cage. This wasnt it. I wanted to see him getting crazy and showing emotions like the other 2 movies I mentioned and instead we got a non-speaking dull and boring protagonist.Ok at first it was charming to see him not utter a single word but later in the moive I was shouting at the monitor: ""TALK DAMN IT""!. Very poor execution of a non-speaking protagonist!Also I really hoped he had some background for example his wife and kid(s) were killed but he somehow survived and returned to avenge their deaths or maybe he was a kid that witnessed some killings taking place and had so much trauma he couldnt speak after it - NOT! Not a single scene where ANY of his behavior is explained. The moments when hes so much sticking to his schedule and letting the kids die really angered me too. Again NO EXPLANATION whatsoever about that too!All in all a very VERY big disappointment.",3.0,4322

rchosen-193-5535," Come for FNAF, stay for Cage, forgot it all after.",Im not a fan of Five Nights at Freddys a video game this is clearly based off the idea of. But I assumed this would be very much like that.This movie is cheesy and cringe. Sometimes in good ways sometimes in bad ways. You dont even need much of an IQ to watch this as there is zero deep thoughts in it. Despite being cheesy they try WAY to hard to add some lore to this movies story and to be honest you dont really care because of how bad the movie is.If your looking for scares on levels of the FNAF game you will be disappointed. There are scares but none really catch you by surprise or are all that surprising or shocking. If anything most of them are humorous with how silly they are. Again the movie is meant to be cheesy but this is just cringe. If you are expecting any sort of closure or ending dont expect anything.Cage doesnt talk in the movie which is fine because hes crazy in this as he is in many of his movies and he is entertaining none the less. Perhaps its the only redeeming factor of this movie. I also gave it an extra star because the animatronics were actually pretty good at being creepy (until they spoke). Though it was painfully obvious when they used CGI in some spots and ruins the moment.,4.0,4326

tvalstar99, No tension and stupid,Altough the plot is simple and old telling the story in a different structure could have helped a lot. Also by showing the plot instead of telling the plot there could have been more to figure out by the viewer. AND if the lead character should have showed surprise or fear about what was going on this could have been a nice simple movie. But because all of the above is not there the movie is dumb and there is no tension at all. Just because Nicholas Cage is there in fluorescent light doesnt mean you dont have to work for a movie even as simple as this one.,4.0,4328

haunt_freak, Don't Believe the 10 Star Reviews,"A man runs over a set of police spikes on a highway. Unable to pay for new tires he is told he can work to pay for them. The job entails fixing up a former Chuck E. Cheeses-style restaurant called Willys Wonderland. The animatronics start to come alive and attack the man (who is credited only as The Janitor) as the night continues. He is aided by a girl named Liv and her uninteresting friends (who are only there to serve as a body count later on) who want Willys Wonderland destroyed. The teens were annoying AF and had some terrible acting/dialogue. Liv ultimately proves herself to be a pointless character that really adds nothing to the story except to explain the backstory of Willys Wonderland.The Janitor never speaks and for some reason needs to consume a can of soda every hour and play pinball (and were treated to witnessing this more times than needed). Because he never talks and doesnt have any backstory we dont care about him. It also never feels like hes in any danger when the animatronics attack because he so easily dismantles them each time. Theres nothing more boring than a protagonist who has no weakness. It also makes zero sense why all of the animatronics wouldnt gang up and kill him at once.This wanted so badly to be a campy Five Nights At Freddys movie but it just failed. The Banana Splits Movie did the ""murderous animatronic"" thing much better a few years ago. I actually cared about characters and there was a more entertaining story. Watch that instead.",4.0,4331
IndecentLouie, Exactly as expected,Willys (Wallys?)

stsinger, Insanely Entertaining,"OK ""Willys Wonderland"" isnt a great film. Not sure its even a good one. But it is totally bonkers from beginning to end and is wildly entertaining. Nicolas Cage plays a man just called ""The Janitor"" because he agrees to spend a night cleaning up ""Willys Wonderland"" a run down version of ""Chuckie Cheese."" While hes in there he gets attacked by one of the animatronic animals come to life. He summarily destroys it puts on a clean ""Willys Wonderland Staff"" t-shirt and gets back to cleaning. But it turns out that ""Willys Wonderland"" has a dark and horrific past its no accident that he is in there and that wont be the last monster he faces this night...This movie is insanely entertaining the entire length of its running time. It has a satanic backstory annoying teenagers getting killed in messy and gory fashion and Nicolas Cage going full-on ""Nicolas Cage"" leading to one of the characters saying what should become a classic line -- ""Hes not locked in with them theyre locked in with him.""Totally recommended. Put your brain on hold for 90 minutes and have a great time.",8.0,4347
ryan-44110, Doesn't deserve a 1 but doesn't deserve a 10 either. Let's be real here.,"Spoilers ahead so dont read further if you want to avoid them.Firstly Nic Cage is pretty great in this film. Ive missed him these past few years with very dialed down or tone deaf roles hes been given. He was free to basically have fun... AS LONG AS HE DIDNT SPEAK. Im not kidding he has no lines in the entire movie. I imagine the film only had enough money in the budget to get him on set and not enough to get him to speak. The plot is basically Five Nights at Freddys but the walmart brand and intended to appeal to a much larger audience than 2010 zoomers. That said the action sequences are fun but dont carry the film far enough to be enjoyable. The characters are ignorant to an annoying point. The cops and basically whole town are in on the scheme when they could just as easily nuke the building or shoot up the animatronics. Thatd be too easy. Instead it takes 1 teenage girl with a pocket knife and 1 mute 60 year old to take on 8 or so 90s power rangers villain extras in a span of one night... or 90 minutes. Its super campy... almost as bad as The Dead Dont Die. Complete with a recalled joke of ""punch pop"" soda mandatory break times and a pinball machine mysteriously placed in the kitchen of the restaurant. I get it... once again this is an ironic horror with a low low budget. Is it good? No. Is it awful? Yeah it kind of is to a degree but you can likely sit through it and not be completely disappointed.",4.0,4348
jrugg19," If You Weren't Entertained, you're Lying.",Willys Wonderland is by no means a good movie. If youre expecting a tense atmospheric horror movie inside a Chuck E. Cheese youve come to the wrong movie.This is a self aware black comedy with some decent gore and crazy kills and another fun performance from Nick Cage. Hes fully aware of the roles hes taking nowadays and he clearly has a blast making this one too without saying a single word. His presence really helps this movie too as he knew exactly what tone to go for.As of right now this is probably the closest were going to get to a Five Nights At Freddies movie and its a fun enough time to pass 90 minutes. Just dont expect a James Wan level horror.,7.0,4349

rcaballero-78131, Amazingly bad,From seeing the trailer I truly hope nobody was expecting this movie to be actual horror. Its a great action/comedy/campy movie. Nicholas Cage is a total badass in this movie. Blatant rip off of the game Five nights at Freddies. But honestly its a good watch,5.0,4351
jamhough, Some questionable creative choices let it down,Im a fan of the Five Nights at Freddys video game series and the similarities between the games and this film had me intrigued. Obviously going into Willys Wonderland I wasnt expecting a cinematic classic and was looking forward to a fun B movie. Five Nights at Freddys Nicholas Cage some 80s inspired cheesyhorror how could it go wrong!? Turns out pretty easily.The film struggled to find an identity. Is it a horror? Well theres no real suspense or scares. Is it a comedy? The majority of the jokes fall flat. Is it an action film? Cage awkwardly beats up a couple of animatronics so it has that going for it.The decision for Nicholas Cages character to be mute throughout the film was a brave decision and one that didnt work in my opinion. Would have probably have been better if they gave him some dialogue (Think Arnie levels in Terminator) especially early on as some scenes just felt empty.Emily Tosta was good as the young heroine playing opposite Cage although she probably needed a little bit more direction in the action scenes. Her character definitely came across as the most real overcoming the limitations in script and direction.Like most horror films the film is filled with stupid people making stupid decisions. Cage could easily have just left once he realised what was going on. But after every attack by an animatronic he went back to playing pinball and cleaning the restaurant like he was trying to become employee of the month. The group of teenagers who were too scared to enter and wanted to burn the building down to end the curse predictably ended up going inside. Then once inside rather than leaving again they split up and sneaked off to have sex.Sadly a film that had the potential to be a cheesy fun filled over the top action scare fest just fell flat and even the star power of Nicholas Cage couldnt save it.,5.0,4352
jjays92, Strange and somehow awesome.,I had absolutely no idea what to expect having skipped the trailers Nicholas Cage puts on one of his strangest performances to date capped off with a truly strange dance number.Monsters are definitely unsettling but really dont seem like machines they look and behave like theme park characters.Its a B movie with a small budget and an absolutely ludacris plot.

I didnt want this to end. Nicolas cage is awesome and makes short work of the animatronics.. I actually wish the fight scenes lasted a little longer.

That being said as someone who loves movies that are slightly... well stupid I loved this. It also helps that Im a Five Nights at Freddys fan. If youre a FNaF fan and you found out about this movie through people saying it was a ""cash grab Freddys knockoff"" let me assure you that it really isnt. It has a very similar concept and you can even draw some comparisons between the stories of the film and the game but at the end of the day its a well made movie and if you love the FNaF concept then youll probably like it.",8.0,4357
EvilDead6218, A fun and entertaining horror romp,Nicholas Cage has been in a lot of movies in a variety of roles. It seems as if hes in at least several movies a year. One of the most different and unique movies hes been in to date is 2021s Willys Wonderland.The basic premise of the movie involves a man looking for work whos offered a job cleaning at an abandoned childrens playhouse. Upon working there he soon finds that the place is not as it seems when hes attacked by a group of singing and dancing characters inside.Meanwhile a group of adolescents approach the place and upon learning of its sinister history decides to burn it down. They see the man inside and try to lure him out. Seeing his refusal they go inside to warn him of the danger. They soon see that he has it under control when he attacks the creepy characters that attack him. Meanwhile the group engages in a struggle for survival against the creatures.The police hear of the people killed inside and upon seeing the man inside believe he is responsible for the deaths even though one of the girls in the group try to tell them otherwise.This movie is very similar in tone to the Banana Split Movie and is recommended for fans of that movie or perhaps Childs Play. Anyone who is looking for a movie thats fun gory and doesnt take itself too seriously will find much to love here.,8.0,4358
I_Ailurophile, Fantastically fun and clever,"When I first heard about this movie I fully expected to enjoy it. And so I have. Yet this is so much more than I bargained for or could have anticipated: Willys Wonderland is genuinely brilliant.Lets get this out of the way now: I was expecting a wild splatterfest as animatronics suddenly begin running wild lots of blood and screams rounded out with another outrageous performance from Nicolas Cage. But if you go into Willys Wonderland expecting anything like the typical horror movie youre going to be disappointed. Wonderland takes a very different approach.Where to begin? How about the fact that Nic Cage doesnt have a single line of dialogue in the entire film at most only uttering yells of exertion? Or that we are given no information whatsoever about his character except for the dog tags we see hanging from his rearview mirror? Clearly he has training that makes him an efficient destroyer of animatronics but we get no further detail - and we dont need it either.What really speaks volumes about Willys Wonderland is the flow of the narrative for the first 30 minutes: Having taken on the temporary job as a janitor Cages unnamed character works fastidiously to clean the attraction. He sets an alarm on his wristwatch to take very punctual breaks during which times he meticulously cleans an old pinball machine in the break room and faithfully downs a generic ""Punch"" soda from his collection. What we get is essentially a cleaning montage - interspersed with fights that end in gruesome fatalities. When theyre over its time to clean up put on a fresh shirt then get back to work.Even after those first two kills even after Liv (Emily Tosta) and her friends show up with intent to burn Willys to the ground even when blood begins flowing freely even as the climax approaches - when that alarm goes off the fighting and cleaning stops and another soda and round of pinball ensues. The most emotive Cage gets in the entire picture is during his great triumph at the cabinet.THAT is the sort of movie youre watching.The absolute joy of Willys Wonderland is that it doesnt take itself seriously but it pretends that it does. Everything is portrayed with 100% deliberate deadpan delivery. Im immediately reminded of John Carpenters criminally underappreciated Ghosts of Mars - Wonderland is ridiculously over the top in every way employing every trope and boneheaded narrative choice that it can. In another movie wed laugh at these things and rightly point at them as detractions but in the right hands with sharp and pointed writing it becomes a brazen shameless delight.There are amusingly needless Dutch angles (one in particular with lighting that reminds me of Mandy arguably Cages most perfect film) characters choosing to make out in the middle of a bloodbath and an incredulously ignorant supporting character who consistently makes all the worst choices. Every bit of actual background plot every bit of information about Willys is spilled out in two big chunks of dialogue by two different characters. Complicit locals Satanic rituals a minor ""gotcha"" ending gratuitous lens flare over the top shaky cam as Cages janitor makes kills the decidedly biting borrow of a line made famous by a well-regarded graphic novel: You name it Wonderland has got it.G. O. Parsons writing is impeccable absolutely matching the drily sardonic wit Carpenter demonstrated in my beloved Ghosts of Mars. I love Ã‰mois original score music at once atmospheric and driving that perfectly complements every scene as it plays out - and the small songs they crafted for the feature are very enjoyable especially the titular theme that we get to hear in full during the end credits. The animatronics look great - suitably creepy as they would be even without being monstrous murdering muppets - as do the blood and gore effects which are just plain fun. The whole picture is crisp and clear and Ryan Lieberts editing is exquisite.Nicolas Cage of course gets the most focus from the camera and his understated performance is riveting. Still everyone else is just as fine. I think special mention must be made for Jessica Graves Davis seen here as animatronic Siren Sara. The most humanoid of the antagonists theres a bit of Uncanny Valley going on here in her very appearance and Davis apparently did her own stuntwork as Sara too. Those athletics remind me of Daryl Hannahs Pris in Blade Runner and the overall result is that shes decidedly the most creepy part of the movie.I do have to wonder how much of the budget went to securing the rights for Free bird. But again: Its use is just another perfect addition to the mood of the film and part of an ending I truly love bringing the narrative to a deeply satisfying close.By the nature of the narrative Willys Wonderland is going to appeal to a certain niche audience. The flavor of the narrative means it will genuinely appeal to an even more select number of viewers. Its not what you expect but its what we needed and its altogether splendid.It wont be for everyone but I will never not sing the praises of Willys Wonderland or withhold a recommendation. Its such a great pleasure a joy and youre truly missing out if you dont give it a watch.",9.0,4359

I especially enjoyed Nicholas Cage taking a break from time to time as instructed.It is just funny how his character is a master cleaner. This was definitely included to make it more funny and it worked. And the monsters well they were just play things for the mighty Nic Cage. 1.5/2 for cinematography and directing.The acting slides down a notch but they were very serious making it all the more comic. 0.5/2.

TwistedContent, Self-Aware and Gleeful B-Movie Awesomeness with just the right Man at the front,"""Willys Wonderland"" is the antidote we currently need and deserve and Im endlessly happy just seeing Cage in this very self-aware offering from director Kevin Lewis and writer G. O. Parsons. Nobody could conclude that ""Willys Wonderland"" is a great compelling substantial or original film but aint no mistaking what kind beast this is. An 80s-throwback-trash-splatter-B horror in the best traditions with Cage sailing this ship with unbeatable charisma and content. Its the kind of cheese fest that just begs to be loved.A Quiet (absolutely literally) and mysterious drifter wounds up crashed by a small town where the locals trick him into a janitorial gig at the condemned ""Willys Wonderland"". In the empty family dinner parlor with huge animatronic dolls as the entertainers the drifter starts his mundane mission that soon becomes a battle of survival against satanic fluffy beings. How can you not be interested in Nicolas Cage fighting animatronic animals with mops toilet plungers and more... Doing it all in visceral all-out fashion. Meanwhile the thin backstory reveals as the rest of the characters the typical ones also are on a mission to destroy the evils of Willy. The core idea is essentially ""Five Nights at Freddys"" and the backstory is much the same as Chuckys from ""Childs Play"". These elements are mashed in ""dead by dawn"" scenario and we got ourselves an adventure. It is the drifter whos the most interesting and gimmicky character although many teases about him and more are left unfinished. Its rather impressive though Cage gave an awesome performance without ever saying a single word.Its a film hinging on a singular idea & the abilities of Nicolas Cage but being aware that helps a great deal because there is a sense of glee and fun throughout it is all weird and wacky violent and colorful. The space is limited Cage is wordless and yet filmmakers manage to fill the runtime consistently though originality in the end is not one of the underlined qualities of ""Willys Wonderland"". Fight sequences can be repetitive and quite obscured but for a slasher-type its no different than most in regards of flow. Even though it is unmistakably a real B perhaps at times even C movie the visual panache pleasantly surprised me I was never bored. There are plenty of fun songs in the package as well and I have very conflicting feelings about the inclusion of Lynyrd Skynyrds ""Free Bird"" near the end. Must have cost them most of the budget... Conflicting feelings because it is the ending song of one of my favorite horror movies of all time ""The Devils Rejects"". Felt like a steal.The very fact that we now have a no-frills B horror comedy where Nicolas Cage goes through bloody battles with huge fluffy animatronic creatures is amazing. A slasher that delivers the expected with a side of mmm cheese sauce. Cage is on the right path and Im always legitimately happy to see him work hes the Man and can make my day. Thank You. Id also suggest not wasting your time and hating if B horror is not your jam ""Willys Wonderland"" is balls-to-the-wall exactly that. My rating: 6/10.",6.0,4370
cyguration, Five Nights At Freddy's + Drive Angry 3D,What a delightfully weird little action-horror film. I was originally going to give it a 6 or a 7 but I honestly cant think of anything else they could have done to make the movie better.It is what it is.Nicholas Cage turns in a completely wordless performance as a stranger drifting through towns with an uncanny ability to dish out (and take) pain while guzzling down what is essentially a power-up pop drink.His character acts very similarly to the one from Drive Angry 3D almost giving the impression that this could very well be a non-canonical prequel to that film.However take that character and throw him into whats essentially the basic premise of Five Nights at Freddys and you get Willys Wonderland.I agree with a few other reviewers that this film acts on certain levels of B-movie camp without going too far into the realm of the absurd (based on the worldbuilding it receives) and is definitely worth comparing to films like Evil Dead 2.The effects are oftentimes cheap (due to the budget) and there arent many locations on display but with the little they had to work with the film is instantaneously a cult classic.Unlike some of Cages other flicks like the infinitely unwatchable Jiu-Jitsu which was just bad all the way around Willys Wonderland has its heart (and gore) in the right place and is a fast-moving thrill-ride from practically start to finish. The quick-edit segments reminded me a lot of Sam Raimis style of directing and the use of practical blood effects were sparingly but wisely used.If you want something a little bit different from the typical horror fanfare I would definitely recommend Willys Wonderland. Also if youre a fan of horror films where the hero actually FIGHTS back then you will love this movie to death.,10.0,4371

randomtrp, So bad it's bad,Let me be clear: I did not willfully watch this. This movie is quite masterful in that it masters the art of telling nothing. With an hour and a half Nicky Cage and 5 million dollars it managed to tell nothing. There is no plot. Half of the characters have no lines (or Id wish they had no lines theyre just that bad). This movie is a black hole. It sucks in your time your will to live and your brain feasting off of it all like a parasite. In this way life imitates art. Just as the animÃ©tronics suck away life this movie also sucks away life. Just like Kathy sucks **** this movie sucks ****.My friends pressured me into watching it despite my best senses. In this way my experience with this movie is my fault and I ruined my own life. At times I was secretly hoping that this movie was real for then I could sacrifice my godforsaken friends to the animemetronics and then join them in tormenting my friends for eternity.A lot of people call this a B-grade film. I think thats quite generous. Those people are kinder souls than I. However not all is bad. This film is definitely an experience and your life will be changed forever once youre done. Whether thats for better or worse it doesnt matter because you just wasted 90 minutes of your life and you will never get a chance to fix that.If you have nothing left to lose and yet you still want to lose something Id recommend this movie. Or if you want to give someone the mens rea to go through with your murder Id also recommend it. Or if youre deranged enough to watch it for the meme then go ahead (and promptly get some help following that).,9.0,4390

olddaniel, Another horrible FNAF rip-off,"Despite not being a huge fan of FNAF the concept is pretty cool but to make it a good movie takes dedication a good script a talented director and a decent budget. ""Willys Wonderland"" has none. The opening sequence starts with Nicholas Cage who is 60 pretending to be on his late 30s driving a sports car and has an unhealthy obssesion with energy drinks. He has no lines during the entire movie I guess hes supposed to play the silent protagonist in video games since obviously this movie is inspired from a video game but it just doesnt work. His character has no backstory and gets boring since he doesnt get any character development as the movie goes on. He also seems to have some sort of superhuman strength as he is the only one who is capable of destroying any of the animatronics with little effort. The other characters in the movie are either there just to be killed or for some plot exposition. And some of them do REALLY stupid things! There is one moment in the movie where two teens have sex inside the ""Willys Wonderland"" while being perfectly aware that killer animatronics are watching them and are about to kill them one of the teens even say ""lets give them a show!"" Absolute cringe. As for the animatronics it initally starts good with them being pretty creepy and staring at the actors when theyre not looking but once they start talking it goes downhill from there. Most of their dialogue consists of insulting the characters with crude language that is neither scary or funny. Having them not talk would have made them scarier. The special effects are cheap too. Some of the animatronics are clearly people in costumes and it really ruins the movies concept. Overall I dont recommend this film.",2.0,4394
sikkwolf, Nicholas Rage is slowly becoming irrelevant,"This movie is one of the dumbest things Ive ever seen. Cage doesnt say a word the entire film the victims do the dumbest things they possibly could in the lisle of a situation they know is untenable and will likely result in their deaths... The ""storyline"" is some kind of weird nonsense about the town sacrificing people to possessed animatronics which now house the souls of serial killers?I dont know... The action sequences are poorly shot even more poorly choreographed Ava ultimately stuck fun of of the movie. I mean it could have been very entertaining with some effort but none was given and so it is not. We watched PG: Psycho Goreman right after this and we loved that... I mean PG is ridiculous but its hilarious and clearly a labor of love for 80s and 90s shows imagined through a lens of bizarre humor.I only bring that upbbecause that is what it feels they wanted WW to be but falls short everywhere; its just not a good movie at all.",2.0,4395

Cage is good here in a mental role in a mental film so it pretty much works out lolThis is no instant Classic or Masterpiece but its a wild ride & humourous bloody B-movie good time with music & its look is very 80s in style & it couldve came out then & wouldve made more sense coming out during the 80s lol.

sflanagan-47676, Chuck E Cheese Meets Devil Worshipers,"I found myself kind of enjoying this film for what is was a dark comedic horror show.Cages role as an ex-military soda pop drinking no talking badass was pretty good. His single minded pursuit of completing his job of cleaning the place was great not letting demonic animatronic puppets or teenagers getting killed left and right get in his way. Even the name of character was great simply being listed as ""The Janitor"".I thought it was a good way to kill an hour and a half in an evil dead sort of way.",7.0,4406

Not because it follows the trend of having women being the alpha characters and portraying men as either weak or stupid but simply because its a lazy effort.

dmbelafan, Must have seen a different movie.,"Saw an advanced screening - this was the most excited Ive been to see a movie in a very long time. It appears Im in the minority who found it to be frankly terrible. While the performances of the leads were enjoyable I found the movies writing and direction so flawed as to be practically unwatchable.Gadot continues to embody WW laudably if leaning at times toward overacting. Pine is effective as the ""fish out of water"" launched several decades into the future even if some of his comedic moments with Gadot fall flat. Pascal plays a classically over-the-top 80s villain with enthusiasm - it seems he relishes every moment getting to play a bad guy. For me Wiig gave the strongest performance of the first act - her comedic timing is given plenty of time to shine and the audience has ample opportunity to empathize with her. Unfortunately these four performances were not enough to dig this film out of the hole the writers created.Written with an over-inflated sense of self-importance riddled with clunky dialogue trying desperately to convey depth and universal truths the end result is an endless stream of cringeworthy eye roll inducing lines that are so on the nose I wonder how they made it out of the writing room. At no point does the film treat its audience with intelligence opting instead to spoon-feed every concept. How do they convey that WW is not only an action hero but an advocate for the humanity in all of us? By forcing her to deliver gems like ""But Barbara what about your warmth? What about your humanity?""Further issues presented as they occur to me as I tire of reflecting on this mess:Why is the heist scene so intentionally campy? The movie is *set* in 84 not *made* in 84. Fortunately the remainder of the film abandons this style.Their *most* creative way to sell Barbara as awkward but likable is to have her drop her briefcase of papers? Couldnt come up with something original?All Smithsonian employees have access to an unguarded airfield? A WWII pilot can understand the controls?No fully-fueled fighter jet has a range to fly DC to Cairo.WW has only ever vanished a coffee mug in all her trying but can suddenly vanish the jet ""because she must"".""I know were racing against time to save the world but lets go fly through some fireworks. Itll look cool promise.""One moment WW can effortlessly sprint pushing a disabled armored vehicle down the road the next she cant push two of them apart with all her might.The moment she rolls along the road with the two children in her arms is astonishingly poor CGI. Throughout the film the most obviously CGId elements simply have no weight to them.Dont play the audio of Steves ""how to fly"" speech over the moment WW takes it to heart and learns. Trust your actors and audience. Show dont tell.Max didnt think to steal health in return for wishes until the end of the third act?Cheetah has practically zero screen time to pose a real threat. One fight and shes dealt with handily.Hundreds of nukes launched and they dont vanish - they crumble in mid-air. This is somehow not a problem for the planet?Returned to the white house grounds Max somehow lands within yards of his son who has been wandering abandoned highways?Linda Carters cameo was *painful*. If she didnt actually smile and wink into the camera it sure as hell felt like she did. I wont be re-watching to find out for sure.Im tired of griping. I wanted so badly to like this continuation of the DCEU. Ill be there for the next one hoping for better but my god was this a disappointment. I saw the movie for free and the cost was still too high.",2.0,4410
kim-toronto, Romantic Drama Missing Good Parts,This tells you how arrogant Hollywood is and how lowly they think of their audience.They throw any rubbish at us. Every film must have a sequel. No ideas doesnt mean no movies.

cogatlin, Horrendous,First off I loved the first movie and was looking forward to the sequel. That being said this was a disappointing convoluted mess. Its like a train wreck and a dumpster fire had a baby then the baby puked and that puke became this movie. Seriously what were they thinking with this script? So many talented actors and so much wasted potential.So because the script says so Diana can make things disappear at will? She can swing from lighting with her lariat? She can block and catch bullets with her lariat? She can attach and swing from airplanes that are at cruising altitude while shes on the ground?! All of these exaggerated abilities while shes supposedly losing her powers? Another thing her suit was supposed to be powerful yet it crumbled like tinfoil during her five minute fight with Cheetah. What was the point of her wearing it then if she was back at full strength?Max Lords character was laughable. The stone wasnt crumbling with every wish so why was he getting sick after granting wishes even though he became the stone? None of this lunacy made any sense whatsoever.This movie was so bad that I walked out of my own house. Seriously skip this and watch the first movie.,1.0,4413
sduncan15, Makes Justice League and Suicide Squad look Oscar worthy,I have low expectations for DC movies. Some have delightfully surprised me. This falls flat on its face after 15-20 mins and never gets up...or even TRIES!! It felt rushed through production (definitely not in watch speed...). It was boring when their wasnt action and when the action started it was so fake it was distracting. Gadot and Pascal try and maybe have moments that dont suck. Wiig was...well exactly how you would expect her in an action film as a villain.To say the movie is disappointing is an understatement which is sad considering I had zero expectations going into it.

kim-erp-vp, The main actress,Her acting is so stiff that I hesitate to use the word. I mean is she really an acting or does she know someone/casting couch/lottery winner.Someone explain to me.Bring Meg Ryan back.,3.0,4431
jaimemedina-36288, Utter disappointment,Ive been eagerly waiting for this. I made a great lunch of Christmas Eve leftovers and sat down - ready for a great movie.This movie is utterly ridiculous. From the moment it starts it comes off almost as a parody. The open scene is very childish. Way too on the nose with its moralistic foreshadowing. The following failed heist is equally juvenile - taking place in a mall and is just plain silly. Its far from the grittier atmosphere that DC has been so good at recently.The interpretation of 80s culture is completely distracting and strips away any gravitas. Pedro Pascal comes off as laughable and inane. Wiig fairs no better and cannot pull off the baddie.It was hard to watch. I had hopes for DC but this one is a complete dud.,2.0,4432
james-info-reviews, Welcome To James' Reviews (where we bring you more than mere reviews),James: i Patty thanks for joining us. Our readers are excited to read about your latest work.Patty: yeah you are referring to Wonder Girl.James: Wonder Woman.Patty: yeah that. Woman All good.James: It was not well received.Patty: Wanda is a good woman and deserves better from people.James: Wonder not Wanda... and also many comments point out you cannot write or direct or anything creative for that matter.Patty: That is unacceptable.

This is 2021. We shot this in 2020. We were not on set. We were phoning it in.James: That makes more sense than you know! What about the terrible effects?Patty: Well I am artiste. Affirmative action artiste. I demand authenticity! So we brought the computers used on the original 70s series out of storage for this.James: At least you are not a liar.Patty: You are not listening James. I dont need to lie. I am a woman. I have to get my quota of jobs. Thats how it works in Hollywood. Wanda Woman whatever Girl I can pick as many as I want.James: so what have you picked next?Patty: Something called Star Warts.

steventonge, Just read the other review. All true!,Why is Warner Brothers hell bent on destroying a potential gold mine that is the DC franchise. I thought they had finally sorted it with WW and Aquaman. But no normality resumes. This movie was terrible at everything. Story dialogue acting cgi. Just sell the franchise to another studio and give us DC fans a break,1.0,4435
paul-wife-taker, terrible cast and crew,I have a revelation for all these people... ready??? ... here it comes.... you do not need to always shoot sequels... you can let it be once in a while.I pity the fools who dug their own graves by being involved in this like the useless gal gadot whose only merit is she is not fat like the women from Georgia.,3.0,4436
jehan-hossain, Don't waste you time,Avoid at all cost. The storyline is absolutely garbage. The whole cast should be recast. DC continues to disappoint.,1.0,4437
bjsaint-34582, The WNBA of Hollywood movies,Imagine that every subsequent sequel after any movie is slightly worse than the movie before it. (I.e. Pirates of the Caribbean X-men)Now imagine that this movie is Wonder Woman 1984 as in Wonder Woman the 1984th movie. Hot circle of garbage.,2.0,4438
brian-in-80210, Wow they let this director work on Star Wars?,Didnt they learn from Rian johnsons fiasco??WW 1984 is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. Dont waste your time and watch it. Its is very bad. Not worth to turn on the television. Gal Gadot should just take it off.,3.0,4439
msskrads," Sorry Patty, you tanked!","I agree with the review ""utter disappointment"" I also read the Washington Post article. "" really getting to do whatever I wanted"" she said. And what a sad commentary that turned out to be. All of her characters props and settings were ridiculous. Kristen Wiig injects one of her babbling SNL characters in her first scene. A super villian shes not even for comic relief. And where is the strong empowered woman that encourages other women to use their own powers? Then there is that magic lasso Diana might just as well sat and her desk in the museum and flicked it to and fro since it appeared to have an infinite length this time around. Placing the film in her memories of the 80s this might work for Coppola or Scorsese but ones sense of history needs to be able to look further into the past to develop a view. Was that President supposed to be Reagan surely you could have found someone who actually resembled him. So much for 80s memories. The scenes of an injured and defeated WW were way to drawn out and the computers of the day were only beginning to go beyond pixelated pictures. The technology of the day would not have been able to broadcast to the world. And Gal Gadots talents were never realized she just wasnt involved enough beyond window dressing more attention was spent on the sets and locations. And what disappointment the release streaming and theatre distribution. Although I love theaters (I spent 35 yrsin the movie business) where I live they havent reopened yet. THe streaming was terrible stop stutter freeze. fortunately the movie was so bad the pauses were a relief. I wonder what Bill Diehl or Roger Ebert would have had to say about WW84? Im glad I watched the credits I couldnt believe how many people were listed. But then Lynda Carter made an appearance. 15 seconds of Joy out of 2 and 1/2 hours.",1.0,4440
the_real_smile, Actionhero movie with almost no action,Writer producer and director Patty Jenkins really did a give this movie a feminine/soap opera touch and by doing so destroyed everything that this movie could have been. The first WW movie was not that great but Patty did not write that one this sequel she did and it is worthless. I was wondering if I was watching a drama or a action hero franchise. First the movie is far to long the dialogues are pointless and boring you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action the effects are good not worth the time to watch but still well made but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl.,4.0,4441
kuzaceto-kaan, Boring,BoringThe making of this movie was not very good. I do not understand that what is the point of making this type of sequel if they struggle with a story. Gadot has a nice body (probably massacring indigenous people) but otherwise not an actress.,3.0,4442
Melius, Who said she can act?,Very bad acting. Very bad script. Very bad direction. What a let down. Gadot is as beautiful as she is the worst actress to hit the superheto firmament. Paid 30 bucks to syream this awful mess on xmas day. Ruined xmas or whatever was left of it after cpvid. A disappointing film for a disappointing year. Want my money back.,1.0,4443
jayg_58," In quarantine, you'll buy anything.",Very colorful lots of money spent. Kristin Wiig was a masterpiece of miscasting. She wasnt funny; she wasnt scary but great costume. The whole plot was a vehicle to resurrect Chris Pine but there was no real chemistry between them. It made the lines of endearment quite awkward and the embraces seemed forced. All the usual tropes: WW loses some of her powers so there can be suspense; she plays Spiderman and holds two vehicles apart. Just nothing new and Gad Gadot proves again that shes a glamour model and poses well. She cant act. Still - entertainment in a vacuum of good movies so watch it and be distracted for TWO AND A HALF hours.,5.0,4444
faerysoff, Awful,Most of the budget went to the Gadot and her makeup. Special effects at the level of the 2000s. The plot is just terrible. This is the final of Gadots career.,1.0,4445
jamal-salen, Cancel that sequel!!,I know telling Hollywood to not make another sequel is like trying to tell a junkie not to shoot up again but seriously put yourself out of misery shoot yourself and spare the world of your atrocious so-called Wonder Woman.The actress is so bad and she cannot even pronounce her words. The writing almost seems like deliberate sabotage. The director looks like a drama school drop out but the studio the studio.Who greenlighted this read this reviewed this looked at the final product and allowed this to be released??? That person needs to move to a town in a dump like Tennessee wear a fake mustache and become a Wal-Mart greeter.,3.0,4446
mahnoor96, Cats is a better movie,Gal gadot can not act. Full Stop. The script was atrocious nothing flowed. Best parts of the movie is are the supporting cast. And the best 1 minute of this movie was the after credits scene.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.,1.0,4447
axnjxn1701, Patty Jenkins should be fired. Never let Gal Gadot 'produce' again...,What in the giving world was this? Absolutely horrible. Two villans terrible storylines lackluster sparkle zero development charm seen in the first film 4th grade level special effects... Terrible. Whomever gave Gal the authority to produce this should be fired. I expect Patty Jenkins to receive a due tongue lashing for this 2020 mess of a mish-mash. Talk about setting back the female Superhero adrenaline train...Im at a loss here literally. I feel like this disaster of a DC movie rivals the 4th iteration of Hulk just constant senseless numbing devalued uninspiring ridiculous visuals. Gal brought grace to the first one; empirical music clashing with slow motion videography and power through speed and her wrists. This one... GMAB.Poor Chris Pine I hear hes willing to take another potential celebrity bashing for WWIII too...,2.0,4448

roger-b-i, Cannot give it a 1/10,The acting is bad and like most new Hollywood movie no one knows how to edit a film but unlike most Hollywood films Gadot and Wiig are thin and attractive and show legs and cleavage. That has got to count for something and it does.What makes me really wonder is about the budget. The CGI was so weak and fake.,3.0,4450
IMDb-insider, IMHO,Gal Gadot Jenkins and the Warner studio executive have no place in the film business. They really do not express much that is either new or entertaining. The weakness shines here where the bad acting bounces off the bad story which bounces off the bad direction. And who decided that this may go ahead and be released to the public?,3.0,4451
qck1, And I thought the first one was bad,Not sure there is a single thing in this movie that was better than the first and that was not that good. At least in the first one it was an interesting twist on the original Wonder Woman with it being in WW1. The acting seemed stilted and the script definitely was miserable through most of the film. The first scenes were just so stupid and pointless. Not sure if I felt that there was any relationship between the experiences of the little girl and the grown Wonder Woman so they could have cut that and the stupid part about the mall. Just so very stupid. I was going to rate it 3 but I reconsidered it was pretty bad.,2.0,4452
stevebarley, From hero to zero in just two WW movies,The 1st WW film was absolutely brilliant and had more ticks than a farmers dog in my book. WW84 is which truly saddens and maddens me the polar opposite. It has a script so weak it should be classed as highly vulnerable a plot that has more holes than my kitchen colander and characters about as believable as a career politician.I did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a Warning - cliff ahead sign.I wont go into detail over WW84s failings as I have a bus to catch...in a week but I think I can reveal my favourite jaw-dropping line from the film without it being a spoiler...... I want to be an apex predator!It certainly made me growl.,1.0,4453

(literally if anyone died you just wouldnt care.)no consequence after saying those 4 words. things magically became normalI dont get how is this even rated past a 5. Critics rating it 9?!?!

rickgartshore, Patty Jenkins Sets Women Back w/ This Rubbish,The first WW movie was amazing! It clearly demonstrated that a woman super hero can be strong smart funny and most of all can easily hold her own with her male counterparts. It was a monumental step forward for super hero movies and women in general and I couldnt wait for the sequel. It was very disappointing to see the direction Mrs. Jenkins took this character. The WW in this movie represents and displays all of the stereotypical cliches so many serious actresses have worked for years to dispel. In the first WW she was a badass who fought with passion against evil and stood up for her convictions. In WW84 when shes not pining for her lost love (because we all know a woman is lost without her man right?) shes winking at little kids while she fights campy bad guys who are literally tripping over themselves to get caught. The female supporting cast isnt much better. Kristen Wiig is the embodiment of the frazzled clingy stereotype that went out of style in most movies years ago. The only 2 strong women (Connie Nielsen amd Robin Wright) are gone after the first 10 minutes and we are left with weak campy garbage. The WW in the first film was Christian Bales Batman. In WW84 we get the Adam West Batman. Such a disappointment.,3.0,4459

mjpoehler, Vastly Disappointing,The first movie was great.I wonder why Gadot agreed to do this one. I really wonder why with all the good things DC have been doing recently they chose to do this to the franchise.The film had a very few moments of grace but then just let them all go. If youre keen to watch it wait for one of the streaming services to pick it up.,2.0,4471
GetTheNak," What a joke, a really bad joke.",Fifteen minutes into the movie and Ive writing this review while Im watching the movie because I know I wont miss anything. Even the 70s WW series with Linda Carter was less campy than this movie. Its too bad I really enjoyed the first Wonder Woman. As a matter of fact I think stop watching this and go rent the 70s WW series. You should too.,1.0,4472
NarniaIsAwesome, Wonder Woman 1984 is... A Wasted Concept.,"This is gonna be a long one... here we go...First Id like to dissect every character one by one starting with Diana.Ill get right to it: shes boring. Seriously shes awful. Gal Gadot makes a great Wonder Woman visually but her performance lacks a lot. Shes just not fun to watch. She has cool scenes and stunts but she doesnt look like shes having fun. While the film has its serious moments it does have the sort of wild epic-ness that warrants a more excited heroine.Even when the script tries to make her ""have fun"" she just cant. I understand that Wonder Woman is supposed to be a more elegant character in general but something about Gadots acting just makes everything fall flat. I dont enjoy seeing her be awesome because shes not enjoying it either. Shes going through the motions of being cool and just comes off like a depressed and generic good guy.Aside from her personality the position theyve put Diana in doesnt make sense.I refuse to believe that Diana hasnt changed her name in 60+ years. Wonder Woman is perhaps the most invaluable superhero; she is quite literally a ""god killer."" One can only imagine that there are many other gods goddesses and immortal beings who would want her dead.I was honestly expecting us to find Diana living off the grid in a low-rent apartment moving around and working odd jobs to make ends meet (when she wasnt stopping petty crime of course). But no we get a rich high society Diana who works at a museum flaunting her inhuman knowledge and qualities - basically a sitting duck for her enemies.But enough about her.Next we have Steve... oh Steve... youre just the worst. Now Steve doesnt do anything wrong - hes simply dull as a blank wall. He adds nothing to the story - well his presence does but not him as a character. Hes expendable; you could swap him out with anyone else and the effect would be the same. Also Chris Pine has absolutely no chemistry with Gadot; he was clearly only cast because hes considered eye candy for the ladies.Now for the villains... this is where it gets interesting... the bad guys are way better than the heroes. As I said above Steve and Diana are painfully boring and blank. However this movie has some of the best villains Ive seen in a recent superhero film.Max Lord played by Pedro Pascal absorbs the power of an artifact called the Dreamstone which gives him the ability to grant wishes. However he also takes something from whoever had their desire granted. Obviously this goes horribly wrong and eventually the world descends into chaos. Max (who is loosely inspired by J.R. Ewing from Dallas; change my mind) is a surprisingly engaging character. The actor did a good job portraying him; I know he sounds boring but he stole the show every time he was on screen.Finally we have Barbara aka Cheetah. Her story starts a bit slowly even invoking the age-old trope of a stereotypically dorky girl who becomes confident. But Kristen Wiig actually gives the character enough charisma that she is more likable than Diana. This is what I talked about earlier. Once Barbara becomes Cheetah she is the kind of character Diana shouldve been.Shes cool and fun to watch she looks like shes enjoying the battle she has spirit - even though she was supposed to be evil I actually enjoyed seeing her beat up Diana!Yeah I know that sounds awful but this brings me to my final point: what I liked most about this movie was the films biggest flaw.If Im rooting for the villains that means the heroes sucked (which they did). Dont get me wrong bad guys need to be interesting in a story but the heroes also need to be charismatic and awesome. I wanted to see Barbara succeed and once she did she seemingly surpassed Dianas level. Therefore it was easier to dislike Diana.Now onto my final complaint: why on earth was this set in the 80s? Both the title and the marketing for this movie made it seem like it was no mistake that it took place in 1984. Clearly it was for nostalgic purposes but thats just it... theres no nostalgia. This couldve been set in literally any other decade and been the same.Now Im not saying it needed to be heavy-handed playing cliche and overused songs every five seconds but there is absolutely nothing in this movie that utilizes its setting. There is one opening scene that takes place in a mall but its entirely pointless and could be cut out of the movie.There were just so many opportunities to make Wonder Woman even cooler with this like playing rock/synth music while she fights or having her duke it out with Cheetah in a theater while The Terminator is on the screen. But there is nothing of the sort.Now this wouldnt be so much of a problem if the year 1984 wasnt such a big part of the plug. If it was just called Wonder Woman II in regular font who cares. But when you call it WONDER WOMAN: 1984 with retro colors and title style the audience expects more clever nods to the decade.I suppose Ive went on and griped enough; in short its an okay movie but it couldve been a lot better. I like some of what they did but the rest certainly isnt what I wouldve done with it.",5.0,4473
lindazenitha, WORST MOVIE EVER,Bad plots bad actress. Bad choice of the way develop the storyWaste of time to watch.,1.0,4474
arnkp, It's pretty awful.,"I definitely think it deserves more than 1 star but it doesnt come close to living up to the hype or the hope for a great movie. Beginning is fun when she competes as a little girl and feels like groundwork for the coming story but then the rest of the movie has nothing to do with the beginning. The mall scene at the beginning is really really awful! The other fight scenes are just okay but not terrible. The story is pretty bad but there are far worse. Ive never been a fan of the ""superhero loses their powers"" plot line. Steve coming back in someone elses body is super weird. You want him back somehow but not like that. Cheetah is an interesting idea but they didnt utilize her like they could have. I was expecting an epic matchup between she and Wonder Woman at the end. Not there. If you blink you will miss it. Its just an okay hero movie. Its not great but better than 1 star.",3.0,4475

meathookcinema, Wonder Woman 1984: The Quest For Peace. Awful.,The sequel to Wonder Woman was rescheduled time and time again because of the emergence of COVID-19 and cinemas being off limits. Its finally been released however but can also be streamed on HBO Max which has made some to say that cinemas may be a thing of the past.So is this sequel as good as its amazing first film?The film opens with Diana reminiscing to when she was a child and taking part in an Olympics style event in which she excels until she is felled by a tree branch which makes her fall from the horse that carries her but then decides to cheat to try and take the lead. She is found out to have cheated however and whilst she is heartbroken at not having won she is told that her time will come. This opening is in keeping with the first film and is fantastic.But as the film then flashes forward into 1984 it starts to come seriously unstuck. Its easy for films to fall into a kind of exaggerated unrealistic and truly irritating parody of a decade especially one that is larger than life like the 1980s. The film falls headlong into this trap and so the 80s we see is wall to wall bad fashions people eating fatty foods in abundance and littering. It feels fake and manufactured. If there was a hashtag that could be used here for the Twitterati it would be #notmy80s. Ah but this is the vision of the 80s that is individual to this film and Patty Jenkins I hear the comic fanboys screaming. Then in that case it just plain sucks.There then comes an action sequence in a shopping mall in which WW foils a robbery. Its so pointless and pathetic that I actually shouted out in the cinema This is awful! I even for a nanosecond thought of walking out. This would have set a new record for the fastest time Ive walked out of a film having lasted only ten minutes watching Freddy Vs Jason.Fortunately the film calms down on the over the top 80s schtick as we see the main narrative for the film- an artefact known as the dreamstone which can fulfil the wish of those who touch it but with a catch. For every wish the person loses something else dear to them. When I heard of this premise for the film it seemed fine. But as is stated by characters within the film this is actually based on the urban legend of the Monkeys Paw. When I found this out (and by characters in the actual film!) the premise disintegrated right before my eyes. I felt robbed and the whole premise for the film felt lazy. In fact very quickly in the film I found myself thinking I really dont care what happens to ANY character in this film. Nothing in the films runtime swayed me from this.Diana wishes for Steve Trevor to come back and hence this is how we get Chris Pine back in the sequel. However with this wish coming true we see WW start to lose her powers. The scene where we see him reappear should have had a massive emotional pull for the audience. There was nothing. This film is just like its depiction of the decade it takes place in- all surface no depth.We are introduced to the socially awkward Barbara Minerva who wishes to be just like Diana. She gains her wish. She later wishes to be an apex predator. Again she gets her wish and transforms into supervillianess Cheetah. The first glimpse of Cheetah was so naff I actually burst out laughing.We also get another baddie in the form of orange man bad Max Lord who is based on Donald Trump. Theres even a border wall in the film. Hmmm. The President of the United States in the film is obviously based on Ronald Reagan. There are even allusions to his Alzheimers with him saying that felt completely disorientated and somewhere else during one scene. Or maybe with such as admission hes based on Joe Biden instead.The real problem for me throughout the film are the scenes that involve Wonder Woman which is massively problematic based around her character. The action scenes contain the worst examples of CGI Ive seen in a long long time. There are times when Wonder Woman feels more like an action figure in a really badly conceived computer game from the early 00s.There is also a scene in which we are introduced to a new power that Diana unveils. She can turn objects invisible by simply touching them. This made me roll my eyes when I had already rolled them far too many times already. Maybe she can also make this film half its running time I found myself thinking.Another scene that had me rolling my eyes was when Barbara decides to go to the gym when she discovers she has superstrength and decides to lift weights. There is also another cringy scene when she bumps into the creepy guy who harassed her earlier in the film.But there are scenes that work. When Diana finds out she can fly its through a statement Steve has made earlier in the film about his love of flying. These scenes are beautiful to behold and dont involve dodgy CGI. This scene works amazingly well. If only the care and attention that had gone into this scene could have been applied to the rest of the film the whole movie would be more of a rewarding experience.I enjoyed the scenes of Maxs health getting worse with every wish he bestows. This could have been exploited more with him disintegrating more radically throughout the film a la the undead character in An American Werewolf In London. But I appreciate that that might not have been appropriate in a film aimed primarily at children.When Diana has to say goodbye to Steve so that she can get her powers back again there should have been more emotional resonance for the audience. Again there wasnt any.In fact when I heard that Diana was to lose her powers to get Steve back I instantly thought of Superman 2 with Superman willingly renouncing his superpowers so he can enter a relationship with Lois. But whilst I was hoping for a sequel as good as Superman 2 for Wonder Woman instead we got Superman 4: The Quest For Peace resplendent with a naff call for world peace in a nuclear free world.After the first film I would have wished for a sequel. After seeing Wonder Woman 84 I renounce my wish.,3.0,4481
krazysoon, Un-Wonder Woman,This has to be one of the worst movies of 2020. I waited patiently for this film to release and I was dismayed by what I saw. The action is dull the acting is wooden and dialogue sounds like it was written by a first time writer. If you love cliches this is your movie. Its filled with them and you just have to roll your eyes. Superman v. Batman is far more superior than this film. Director Patty Jenkins really dropped the ball. The first film was so much better. What blows my mind is that the movie was directed by the same person who directed the first one. I think it was the right decision to split the release between digital and theatrical because it was not going to make its profit back just by doing a theatrical release let alone on demand. I dont recommend this movie. Id advise you wait until its free on tv in about a year. Its that bad. It pains me to be so critical of Wonder Woman because Im a huge fan. However Im not a fan of a director who cant even make a decent sequel. This is the same director who is going to direct Star Wars Rouge Squadron in 2023. If you love Gal Gadot check this movie out other then that this is a hard pass.,1.0,4482

aaronka-16580, Failed sequel,The first WW was a decent movie the second installment is not.The plot is basic and has been done before. The setting is 1984 we get it but really has no bearing on the story at all. However the movie sure made sure to show plenty of pastel colors and popped collars because you know the 80s.The CGI is really bad in some places and the action sequences are also stale and boring. This film does nothing to set up any future stories within the DCEU or really shed any light on WW other than the opening scene showing her as a child.The worst part of all has to be the ending. Max Lord has to touch people to grant wishes but at the end all he has to do is appear on TV? What!? Also to break the wishes he granted all a person has to do is renounce the wish.

Darkweasel, More of the same. But Bloodier.,"Mutated hillbillies can be a real pain in the arse. And eye socket. Basically more of the same from the franchise that wants to be the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This time out instead of Eliza Dushku we get the quite gorgeous Erica Leerhsen (from... wait youll never guess - The Texas chainsaw Massacre remake) and the less than lithe figure of Henry Rollins as the main characters. A reality TV show show called The Apocalypse sets up its cameras in the same mutant-infested forest as the last film and the local residents quickly set about slicing and dicing the interlopers like an enraged Gordon Ramsey. Body parts fly off in every direction and blood gushes spurts leaks drops squirts and cascades in virtually every scene. If you could define this movie in one word it would be ""wet"". Theres a gratuitous boob shot and obligatory sex scene to keep the titillation quota up in between the carnage but theres so little story that you could write it on the back of a matchbox. Not that story actually matters here one little bit. Rollins is an ex-marine turned TV presenter who when he realises the hills not only have eyes but bear traps axes and other assorted blunt and sharp weaponry turns into Arnold Schwarzenegger faster than you can say ""Last twenty minutes of Predator"". Im not giving anything away by saying the bad guys get killed and the prettiest girl survives but poor old Hank? Well lets just say hes not likely to feature in another sequel... All in all its your typical teens/twenty-somethings against psychos scenario. All is played out with arse-numbing inevitability with only the gore and death scenes to keep you wondering whats going to happen next. Basically if you didnt like the first one then youll hate this. Oh and it contains probably the most unintentionally stupid tagged on twist ending I think I may have ever seen. One of those moments that if youre watching it at the cinema youll burst out laughing feel embarrassed for a second or two before you realising everybody else has done exactly the same.",6.0,4500
sabine-krahl," gory, entertaining",First i must say Im kinda bored by now with the variations of inbred genetically deformed n so on cannibals but i thought i give it a try as a no-brain movie the only real reason to watch being the participation of Henry Rollins. Also its quite entertaining how the genre tries to outbid the last movie with even more cruel gore than the last one. I guess its become a practice  in which they have a violent film that gets an uncut edition on DVD so it might sell more. As i said as a no-brain its entertaining a great film to watch not alone but with friends-so you can comment on the gory parts.But honestly the remakes and the stealing of old ideas has become so lame,6.0,4501
movieman_kev," the sad fact that excrement like ""Hills have eyes 2"" gets a theatrical release and THIS doesn't is the real travesty","First of all ANYone who hates American Idol (I watch it but ONLY the auditions and even then just to laugh at the bad ones but I digress) will absolutely love the opening sequence where Kimberly Caldwell gets hers. The main plot revolves around a crew of youthful contestants for a Survivor-esquire reality TV show hosted by ex-military man Dale Murphy (the always kick-ass Henry Rollins). Playing their game in the remote backwoods of West Virginia they soon find out that deformed hillbillies are hunting them. Having extremely little to do with the first ""Wrong Turn"" (which I enjoyed as a fun lil diversion) this direct to DVD sequel is surprisingly pretty good none the less. Not only that I truly believe it could be the best DTV sequel of 2007 hands down thanks to a likable cast a fun storyline and not skimping on the gore in the least.My Grade: A- Eye Candy: Crystal Lowe gets topless",9.0,4502
Hmrsmpsn," A movie omelet, but a good one",This movie essentially carries a plot and contains scenes we have definitely seen before. All the actors are cliché actors and everything you see has been done before. However this was done better than most other movies.The plot revolves around a reality TV show in the woods and of course the cannibals are there. It is simple but was good enough to keep me intrigued to go with the movie. There were characters you root for and characters you wanted to die like in any movie but the way they died was awesome. There was a plethora of blood and guts and even some tense moments.A lot better than most other sequels in regards to similar movies like Jeepers Creepers 2 The Ring 2 The Grudge 2 Hills have eyes II etc. I do recommend renting this so you can cheer for those awesome gory kills and waiting to see if they get their revenge.,8.0,4503
CuriosityKilledShawn, A surprisingly good movie.,Low-rent slasher sequels are usually garbage I mean has anyone seen Hostel 2 The Grudge 2 or Hills Have Eyes 2? As a result I really wasnt expecting much of this movie despite enjoying the first not merely for the gorgeous Eliza Dushku either. The premise is nothing new but the characters gore and inventive kills make it well worth watching.The always cool Henry Rollins (who Id pay money just to see reading the bible) plays a retired Army Colonel who is now hosting a faux-post apocalyptic reality game show. The setting: the woods. But not just any woods this is inbred hillbilly territory and they are only too happy to devour a bunch of young city folks.Erica Leerhseen (who seriously does not look as old as she is) plays Nina the cynical jaded one of the group who keeps her cool when the guts start spilling. Usually with these movies you can tell exactly who is going to die and in what order but Wrong Turn 2 still managed to seem fresh. I wasnt simply waiting for characters to die or wishing that theyd hurry up and meet a grisly end since such fodder are usually highly annoying.The one thing that I didnt like was the utterly flat photography. The original had a dark grainy and hardcore look to it but the sequel just seems so clean and bright and open. I think that if Joe Lynch was perhaps a more experienced director then the film would look tighter and more dynamic as it is the cinematography does little to compliment the above-average production design.If you are a fan of the first movie then I totally recommend that you give this one a go. It surpassed my expectations and Im usually quite a snob when it comes to movies.,7.0,4504
Smells_Like_Cheese, A bloody good time!,"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End what I expected to be total trash turned out to be one of the better horror sequels in a while. Wrong Turn is a decent horror movie that I usually recommend to my friends it had a fresh new feel for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre genre. So when my boyfriend and I were looking for a film to watch we came across Wrong Turn 2: Dead End at the video store I was like oh no another crummy sequel to destroy a fine film. But he wanted to see it so we watched it last night I have to say that I was completely wrong about what I thought this film was going to be. Actually this was a fun horror movie you didnt even need to see the first one to get it that was a bonus that not too many sequels give the chance for. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a fun and gory sequel that offers lots of blood and entertainment.A group is about to film another ""survivor"" type of reality show in the middle of the woods. Its called ""Apocolypse"" where they have to pretend that the world is gone and theyre the only survivors and whoevers left standing wins a hundred grand. But things take a very deadly turn when the gang is attacked by blood hungry hillbilly cannibals who want to have them for dinner if you know what I mean. So this turns into a real survivor show when the gang is now fighting for their lives and try to make it out of the woods alive.While there are some stories that had no point to them Wrong Turn 2: Dead End still has an awesome story over all. The deaths were absolutely cool to see I know that sounds bad but I just love a good horror film with the great death scenes. I think the first girl had the best with the ax but Im not going to give that scene away just trust me its a very cool one. I was very impressed with how cool this sequel was and I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan its a fun one to watch.7/10",7.0,4505
chrisbanach-1, What Hills Have Eyes 2 should have been,I was a little tired of all these survival kinda movies all being alike. But if you truly like gore fest this ones a keeper.Most importantly WT2 manages to keep you entertained with some pretty cool new tricks while all other sequels (saw hostel etc...) were not really imaginative when it came to kills.Here its a hell of a ride with really cool kills sequences unseen yet. And the survivors (if any) are absolutely not predictable.Thats why I liked it a script with at last some new ideas unlike all the bullshit out there.Watch it you wont regret it !,10.0,4506

dmuel, this one sucks,This movie sequel was made because the first in the series was a hit. In this one once again we meet the mutant redneck cannibals who live in the sticks and wait with growling stomachs for the next bunch of kids to stumble into their rustic hell-hole. The mutant clan is a little larger in this version including some mutant horny chicks and their backwater shanty comes complete with assorted grisly machines and sundry horrors. Into this mix we add Henry Rollins as a misfit marine hired to lead a reality-based TV show and its several amateur entrants into a backwoods survival game. Among this group are the obligatory obnoxious elements a few babes with repulsive personalities and one or two heroic types. Maybe this sounds good to you so far but the plot is so poorly developed that the movie quickly becomes a just another slasher/gore fest which manages to sustain very little tension. Too bad it was not a bad idea for a sequel but the writers butchered this flick. Watch it only if youre bored or addicted to the genre.,3.0,4508
PoisonKeyblade, By far the best DTV movie EVER!,After four years of anxiously awaiting Wrong Turn 2: Dead End I was not only incredibly surprised but it ended up as one of my favorite films ever. Lightyears better than the first movie Wrong Turn 2 is legions ahead of most movie sequels and is not just intelligent but nasty strange funny and wholly unpredictable. The whole movie is one non-stop thrill ride and the ending is simply perfect.So does the movie tie in well with the original? Yes it definitely does! Besides a few inconsistencies with the two surviving characters from the first film this sequel brings back two of the cannibals and introduces a vast family of creepy disgusting inbreeding freakshows.And lets talk about scares and gross-out factor. Was this movie incredibly disturbing? You bet your sweet ass it was! The acting was not just amazing for direct-to-video fare but the directing and cinematography are stunning. For once we have a highly original plot slightly in the vein of Halloween: Resurrection but far superior.The characters were all incredibly likable and I love how there were several scenes that really give you an idea of personalities character traits and utilizes fantastic dialogue and some of the best and most creative gore sequences on film.Overall Wrong Turn 2 is not simply some crappy direct-to-video waste of time--once again this sequel is so far superior to the original and a new horror masterpiece. For the horror fan Wrong Turn 2 absolutely CANNOT be missed.,10.0,4509
mr_pivac1985," Pass, my god what a heap of garbage",First let me say Im astonished at how many good reviews Wrong Turn 2 has. These people are either trying to market the film and getting a paycheck for it or are MTV-lobotomised children who see gore and wet themselves with excitement.Plot - yet another take on reality TV gone bad. I mean come on reality TV is old hat now never mind movies emulating it (badly).A group of dislikable nobodies sign up for a reality TV show which just so happens to be filmed in the same woods the inbred rednecks from the first movie inhabit and oh my god Im bored just trying to explain it....All you need to know is the acting is awful the direction and script are childish its predictable boring and I cant honestly think of any redeeming features.Rewatch the original instead of wasting your time with this.,1.0,4510
goofy-marick, Best horror flick of 2007,A group of reality show contestants and the shows producers find themselves fighting for their own survival against hideously deformed cannibal hillbillies who plan on making them all their dinner. Yes this is the plot of Wrong Turn 2. However believe it or not the whole reality show sub-plot is actually better than it sounds and thanks to the clever writers it vanishes 30 minutes into the movie. Speaking of which I have to say I was pretty satisfied with the end result since Wrong Turn 2 to my surprise turned out to be the best horror flick of 2007 Ive seen. Think thats not saying much since 28 Weeks Later and Grindhouse were the only solid releases? Well ahm for a little direct-to-video flick that surpasses all expectations one might have - thats really really good. Not saying that this is the best genre offering since Halloween but as an enjoyable pure fun and gory Slasher film the flick just delivers. Have to say I was impressed with Mr Lynchs direction as well since this was unbelievably his first ever motion picture project. The cast is also truly impressing for a DTV title; Rollins kicks ass as always (and sadly gets his ass kicked) the Palladino girl is even better than in Sidney Lumets films and once more Erica Leerhsen impresses even more and shows how very underrated she is the woman should get more roles. The kills are effective and simple the story ridiculous and enjoyable and the flick is pure fun. Not brainy not serious just some great Slasher fun.Worth your money.,10.0,4511

subxerogravity," On it's own it's an OK horror flick, but not as impressive as it's original.",So cool that Henry Rollins is in it and he was nothing but cool in the whole flick. Every time he was on the screen it was the right movie.Rollins plays the host of a stupid looking reality show were the contestants pretend they must survive a post-apocalyptic world but they soon discover how real that scenario is as they end up taping the show in the same woods as a group of psychopathic killers. In this film somewhat of an origin story is given to the inbreed family that does the slashing in the woods but I have to say the group that did the killing in the first film were far more better. Just a little bit more creepy and creative in Wrong Turn. In Wrong Turn 2 it seem they were trying to up the extreme of these characters when it was not needed.By itself its more of a Stereotypical horror film with elements of Predator-like action thanks mostly to Rollins. As a franchise while the original brought freshness to the genre its sequel was stale.,6.0,4513
poolandrews," Outrageously gory sequel, probably the best straight-to-video/DVD sequel ever in fact.",Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (the R in Turn is actually written backwards on the opening credits not that it matters much...) is set in Greenbrier Back County in West Virginia where a new reality show called Active Survivors is being staged six contestants are there to survive the tasks & maybe win $100000. The six contestants are paired up its Nina (Erica Leerhsen) & Mara (Aleksa Palladino) Jake (Texas Battle(!)) & Elena (Crystal Lowe) while Amber (Daniella Alonso) is stuck with Jonsey (Steve Braun) all of whose first task is to find food. Tracked throughout the playing area by hidden cameras they discover finding food isnt as easy as it first sounds their problems increase even further when a bunch of inbred cannibals decide they want to eat all the contestants & production team. Stranded miles from the nearest town & unable to contact anyone the contestants must fight back in a real life game of survival or become cannibal food...This American Canadian co-production was directed by Joe Lynch & one has to say for what it was Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a throughly enjoyable & pleasingly gory horror thriller a direct to video/DVD sequel to Wrong Turn (2003) one has to say I didnt have high hopes for it as cheap sequels to horror flicks usually arent very good & ones that go straight to video/DVD are even more likely to suck. To be fair both Wrong Turn films rip-off other films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) Deliverance (1973) & just about any other slasher film you care to mention & by all rights both should be crap but surprisingly neither are. The script by Turi Meyer & Al Septien does exactly what it sets out to do its a straight forward backwoods slasher flick with loads of over-the-top gore & violence. Call me easily pleased but I loved the gore in this film call me slightly sick but I loved the level of violence & the films intention to deliver lots of blood soaked set-pieces is in my opinion highly commendable. Some unenlightened viewers may say the film is full of pointless gore well as far as Im concerned theres no such thing as pointless gore! The characters are alright I must admit I liked the army veteran Dale as he turns the tables on the cannibals & turns them from being the hunters to the hunted & I also liked the main heroine Nina as I thought she had a bit about her she was vulnerable when she needed to be yet strong when it comes down to it. At only 90 odd minutes in length the film moves along like a rocket your never far from the next blood soaked killing & the climax literally paints the screen red with blood imagine a slaughterhouse but instead of cattle insert human beings. I even liked the ending which points to a sequel & features green toxic waste & an ugly mutant baby!Director Lynch does a good job he has chosen to do away with the suspense tension & atmosphere & goes for all out gore which I for one wont be complaining about. I love gory films the nastier & bloodier the better & Wrong Turn 2: Dead End doesnt disappoint people are chopped vertically in half with axes people have arrows shot into their eyeballs people minced up in huge machines there are cannibal scenes someone gets their throat ripped out & an absolute fountain of blood gushes everywhere someone has barb wire wrapped around their wrists  people are graphically blown to pieces with dynamite axes in heads someone has their back hacked away theres plenty of intestines body parts decapitated heads brains offal gallons of blood bodily parts & severed limbs & much more. Theres also a gross scene when the cannibals force Nina to eat some meat & theres little bits all round her mouth as she cant wipe it off which looks pretty disgusting. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a gore hounds wet dream I guess Im going to have to change my bedsheets tomorrow... Im not sure if this is available in an R rated & Unrated editions but if it is you know which one you should go for & if you dont go & sit in the corner on your own until you do!With a supposed budget of about $4000000 this actually had a pretty decent amount of money spent on it apparently shot in 25 days in Vancouver in British Columbia in Canada this has good production values & is well made. The special effects are good with a mixture between good old fashioned latex rubber & fake blood along with some decent CGI computer effects. The acting is OK I particularly liked Leershen the heroine who has a great way of looking surprised & is also very easy on the eyes. By the way why would anyone call their child Texas Battle?Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a great horror flick which doesnt even try to be deep or meaningful & the whole reality TV show setting is more of a plot device to get people out into the open rather than a deliberate thing which to satirise or make fun of. For what Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is this is fantastic & it also has some of the best gore scenes Ive seen in ages as well which help.,8.0,4514
ElijahCSkuggs, Attack of Psycho Inbred Hillbilly Cannibals Part 2,Heres the plot: Hillbilly Cannibals attack reality TV show crew and contestants. Gore and nice make-up follow but also pretty cliché and weak characters average acting bland dialogue and some boring scenes. But if you liked the first this should be still up your alley.WT2 is pretty much a rehash of the first and if youre a fan of the first then you should be pretty happy with the results from the second. I didnt enjoy the first cause I thought the acting/dialogue was pure grade A crap. The same thing applies here unfortunately. Even more so actually. Though the thing that made Wrong Turn one worth-watching was the hillbilly cannibals and the gore. And like I said above some cool gore and make-up effects are the winning parts of this film as well.I suppose Wrong Turn 2 is a perfect follow up to the original. Its almost exactly the same. Though unfortunately to all the Doucheq fans out there shes not in it. Though there is another hot chick and this one actually shows some boobs. So thats a plus. But unfortunately the downsides of the flick are a little too much. Maybe with Wrong Turn 3 or 4 or maybe even 5 theyll get it right and really go for some real suspense and maybe even cast some actors with experience. Heres hopin cause Psycho Inbred Hillbilly Cannibals are pretty damn cool.,6.0,4515
brislev, My god!!!,Im pretty sure I will regret wasting that 90 minutes of my life!! That is what you would call absolute CRAP. I know its low budget I know its direct to DVD but this is the sort of tripe that gives horror movies a bad name. STAY AWAY FROM THIS. Even Henry Rollins is bad in this. Anyone that had anything to do with this should retire. If I could give this less than 1 I would have. Buckets of blood do not make a movie cool. I seriously cannot believe I watched it till the end. Call me harsh but this is BAD BAD BAD. Just having to write 10 lines about this movie is embarrassing but I warn anyone that even considers watching this dont say I didnt warn you,1.0,4516
gravediggerjak, Better than the first!! Thumbs up!!,Im glad this movie got good reviews It really deserved it. Now i wont spoil anything but this movie kicked some ass. I thought part one was OK. So now onto Wrong Turn part 2. Well i had first seen the trailer online and thought this movie looked to be pretty damn interesting. Also it seemed kind gory but again it was just a trailer so i thought it would be a good idea to watch this. This movie was great. I admit it was far better than part one. Very gory and full of blood. Thumbs UP!!! Great horror film and highly recommended a must buy if you will!!! Go get this movie and buy it for a collectors item!!.,10.0,4517
causeiwantto2001, Much better then I thought it would be!,Most direct to video films are hardly worth watching let alone sequels that are direct to video. However this film did something few films do for me anymore and thats make me jump. The opening scene is fantastic and includes a kill which is both unexpected and unlike many other unoriginal death scenes. The movie does drag abit but is almost nonstop action. Wrong Turn 1and 2 are both worth watching and a third should be out within a year or so (at least I hope it is)This franchise deserves a trilogy ending and I will look forward to it as much if not more then I looked forward to this one!If Saw can still be going strong after 45 or even 6 films. Wrong end can keep us interested for at least a third!,8.0,4518
godzilladom," bad acting, bad script, simply bad",This film wholly relies on its gory scenes to pull the viewer through its entirety.The acting is simply awful when character breakdowns that are so cliché and stereotyped that you cant see past it. This for me made the whole film quite unbearable to watch.There plot line was amazingly bad with probably the worst actor i have ever witnessed becoming some sort of Rambo figure. it is actually very comical.The script is amazingly bad with dialogues that hurt to listen to however its only good points come from the gore. The film depicts scene that are quite disturbing deformed sibling sex and also deformed babies. There is about a gas stations worth of blood involved and few hundred feet of intestine.However some of the effects are bad and unbelievable so therefore all in all i would have to say this and the hills have eyes 2 are simply terrible sequels and i can only warn you to avoid them both.,3.0,4519
Fernando-Rodrigues, how come the cannibals didn't kill the crew while they put cameras all over the woods!?,Stereotyped characters cannibals talking -OH that was ridiculous even though it wasnt all the time- also they had bad makeup and act dumb all the time.. there were a lot of conveniences (like when Nina and Mara caught M and Elena in the woods etcetc..). not the worst sequel.,3.0,4520
A_Probably_Postman, Not too bad for a DTV,DTV horrors are usually especially crappy but Wrong Turn 2 managed to give us at least one character who wasnt a complete stereotype. Erica Leerhsen actually did a good job and her character was written with some actual depth something I was NOT expecting. The deaths were hilariously bad as expected but I love cheesy horror deaths so Im not complaining. Kimberly Caldwell was a funny cameo; poor girls gotta have no money left. All in all it was miles ahead of the original which was a Texas Chainsaw Massacre/The Hills Have Eyes rip-off that pretended it was something new.6/10,6.0,4521
sharron177, excellent movie,This movie was more than I expected. I am an horror fan and the horrorier a movie is the better it is for me. I had my heart racing all through this movie. I love the special effects and often wondered how movie like these seemed so real even though it is not. I wish I could be in a movie like this and to be killed off in the worst possible way even like Kimberly was killed! I have never seen anyone killed off like this before Good Job. I do not think this movie made it to the theatres why did it not? It is so much better than some of them that I had been to the Theatres to see. Maybe there is too much guts and gore in it. Anyway this is how movie is supposed to be and if anyone who reads this can recommend a movie to me which is better than this I will watch it.,10.0,4522
gavin6942, A Blood-Drenched Epic From Horror Master Joe Lynch,"A group of young adults is invited to the cast of a ""Survivor""-style show filmed in the same woods from ""Wrong Turn"" in West Virginia. Apparently the producers didnt bother to check the location out very well in advance because those crazy inbred rednecks are still living here and hungry for young lean human flesh.Director Joe Lynch and the writers of Carrot Tops masterpiece ""Chairman of the Board"" bring us a surprisingly good film. While most straight-to-video sequels are lacking in many ways this one shines forth with originality and vision. Lynchs previous work was in the world of music videos and he transitions very well to the horror style. The fact this film has a reality TV element to it may help but those are not the films strongest parts.Were treated to a woman who is literally chopped in half (vertically) by an ax a scene of an inbred mutant masturbating... and plenty of cannibalism. While the worst thing I can say is that the Morlocks were not the most believable as real human beings if we can look pas that (its horror you know) then the movie really kicks you in the nuts (or ovaries).The lovely Erica Leerhsen takes the lead as Nina Henry Rollins is awesome as the survivalist Dale (a much more natural role than he had in ""Feast"" and a significantly bigger part as well). I was happy to see Daniella Alonso playing the militant lesbian Amber. Alonso had recently appeared in two very awful films (""Hood of Horrors"" and ""Hills Have Eyes 2"" -- see separate reviews) and it was good to see her in something where shes given a chance to really act.Speaking of ""Hills 2"" this film is often compared to it. Theyre both Fox films released in 2007 as sequels to films about mutants who attack people in the wilderness. Well let me set the record straight here: ""Wrong Turn 2"" deserved a theatrical release and ""Hills 2"" deserved to be straight-to-video (or never made at all). This was a big mistake on the part of Fox. In every category ""Wrong Turn 2"" is superior -- acting plot gore nudity humor and action.I am unsure how I felt about Crystal Lowe playing the woman with loose morals named Elena. Sure she was hot and its always good to get excessive nudity and sex in a horror film (gratuitous sex and violence sells). But Lowe needs to start moving into more solid acting. Shes becoming a name and its more from her body than anything else. Maybe thats all she wants -- fame is fame -- but I suspect if she wants a long-term movie career it would be best to move into non-sexy roles soon. Dont get me wrong though -- Ill keep watching her either way.Kimberly Caldwell (""American Idol"") played herself and was amazing. Probably the best acting from a musician since Meat Loaf in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Ken Kirzinger (the new Jason Voorhees) shows up too but unfortunately he plays yet another character where he is unrecognizable.If you liked the first film check this one out. Joe Lynch is poised to jump from novice to veteran in the world of horror if he wants it -- this is precisely the sort of film that gets noticed by the fans. I loved it and I think you will too. Dont rent that lame ""Hills 2"" when you can get the real deal with ""Wrong Turn 2"".",7.0,4523
BloodyEyeBall, Master 'Gory' Piece,Okay youll tell me What ? A straight to video gory SEQUEL!?!? If you tell me Wrong Turn 2 Ill tell you YES. That was AWESOME. The gory part may be disturbing for some people but the action makes the whole movie. Wrong Turn 2 kills off all the stereotypes final girls. Its different brilliant. The whole suspense is based on the surviving of the characters. You think that Mara the shy supposed protagonist girl will survive but NO she ends axed in the head at the first 1/4 of the movie while Nina the goth bitchy girl survives along with Jake the black jock. I really want to make the point on the action. Fight blood suspense you got it. The inbreeds pops out of no-where anywhere and whenever. The characters are well developed all with different personalities. For a sequel well the only things we get back from Wrong Turn 2003 are Three-Fingers more insane than ever and the old timer. Nothing very special on this part but still Wrong Turn 2 is WAY BETTER than Wrong Turn and it made my day !,10.0,4524
AngryMovieNerd," I don't think I have anything good to say about Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, and why would I? (Zero Stars out of * * * *)","****NOTE: Referring to the Unrated Version**** A retired military commando (Dale Murphy) decides to host a reality show where the young participants are challenged to survive in a remote West Virginia wasteland. Little do they know that the woods is home to a breed of deformed cannibalistic hillbillies who are picking them off one by one.I dont think I have anything good to say about Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007) and why would I? Here is a movie that is so sick and cynical in its relentless violence and torture scenes that it led me to the hearts of the filmmakers. Why was this movie even made?! The characters are more or less the usual set of teenagers weve seen in countless other horror movies from the jock the womanizer the ""odd girl"" who could care less and the spoiled brat. But imagine the sick message this movie has for its teen viewers: The primary function of teens is to be hacked to death no matter what their dreams and hopes are.I enjoy a good horror movie sometimes. Some have a plot some dont and of course there are ones that about as bad as this one. The original film while not a great one was at least atmospheric and suspenseful. Wrong Turn 2 on the other hand is 90 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed tortured impaled chopped up and mutilated. Its like watching a film written by a perverted scriptwriter. Thats all this movie is. It is just mindless bloody violence. I felt guilty just watching this movie.And by not giving too much away the movie opens doors for another sequel. Someone should tell them theyve already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making this one.",1.0,4525
ndlogik, OMG This movie sucks.,It gets a 3 for cinematography.Thats it.What is wrong with you people? This movie features some of the worst and most contrived writing Ive ever witnessed. One of the biggest mistakes screenwriters are making in this generation is to include incredibly dating plot items such as reality TV shows vegans etc. And Im vegetarian just to add perspective.Any representative of any race involved should be offended not to mention any representative of any once important punk rock icon whos become a caricature of themselves? Henry Rollins you should be ashamed. Feast was a horror classic including well executed plot lines and death scenes as opposed to this clichéd POS which demonstrates that youll do anything for a paycheck at this juncture.House of the Dead still stands as my Worst Movie Ever but this is a close second. The directing was somewhat respectable and my compliments end there. As a matter of fact Im changing my rating from a 3 to a 2. Please please PLEASE do not make a third part as was left open in the end of this travesty. Please.Theres further analysis I could provide but this steaming pile of garbage doesnt deserve it. Dont waste your time.,2.0,4526
dejan8378, I laughed,"I liked the first part... obviously since I decided to see this one. From the very beginning it was evident that it is low budget and that the director is fond of gruesome and exaggerating. Than the movie turns to a bit better to be honest it even has a few good lines. Next the slaughter began and the movie was going a bit clumsy some good some bad but watchable even on moments inventive and entertaining. During this ""improved"" period I became more and more aware of the B-production and really bad acting excluding Henry Rollins who did a good job. While the movie was slowly turning a bit repetitive and boring with every next scene I feel the director tear the screenplay in pieces and burned them and start to pour everywhere He manages extra fake blood guts livers hearts and all the organs you can think off I think He even probably borrowed or stole from somewhere extra fakes.I mean how much blood and guts can one man or woman have that combined with the unbearable bad acting and now already with ridiculous lines goofs lack of direction or logic became funny I started to laugh out loud while the pieces of people were all around I laughed to the director and people who praised this garbage.",1.0,4527
merleegirl5, lame.gross.dumb.stupid.absolutely perverted,I saw the first Wrong turn about a year after it came out and i loved it because it was a smart witty scary movie which is hard to find. so i was really excited when i found out that there was a Wrong Turn 2. I immediately saw it and was SO disappointed. Not only was it no where near as good as the first one it was completely stupid. The humor in it is sick and the slaughtering is just disgusting. Unlike the original it is filled with a grotesque and stupid plot line killings come left and right and whats even more nasty is that you see the deformedmaniacs have sex jack off and give birth. absolutely disgraceful. I hope you take my advice and skip this one its a shame that it didnt follow in the first wrong turns footsteps. better luck next time!,1.0,4528
yugioh-reextinctionfan, Awesome movie,I know a lot of people hate direct-to-video movies and refuse to watch them. But my question is why? I mean there are so many awesome STV movies out there and Wrong Turn 2 is on that list. I mean its just so awesome! There are some very bloody deaths great acting (Erica Leerhsen Aleksa Palladino and Crystal Lowe are awesome!) and the killers are frightening! They are very deformed and look horrible and you just want to scream when you see them which is good of course. Really believe me this film is great and it rocks big time! The story is a bit silly yes but it isnt really important in the movie and it disappears very quickly so if anyone hates the plot you can relax because it isnt even in the movie that much! Oh and I have to say that I was shocked when I saw one character die in the film because I thought she would live and that death made the film awesome and unpredictable! So I say people see it and ignore that it went direct-to-video because its better than most movies that went to theaters!,10.0,4529
IzzyNoya, Not nearly the scary feel of the first...,Ill say it this movie SUCKS! I caught part (10min) of the first one on cable then rented it and was pleasantly surprised with the talent in it (Dushku Harrington etc). It also had a well paced story and genuinely made you jump quite a few times.This one is as lame as can be. All the characters are clichés with nearly no acting talent Im talking HS student level acting here ROTFL. The inbred hillbillies arent nearly as scary as in the first one...they try to make them kind of comical. The gore was pretty cheesy like something you might see in a Sci-Fi channel original. Even the cinematography in this one is much cheaper/lower budget giving it that made for TV feel.,1.0,4530
springsunnywinter, More blood and guts than the first,The first Wrong Turn was scary & relentless and the second was reasonable. As usual the filmmakers tried to make the sequel better by adding a maximum amount of blood guts gore and violence that reduced the scares and thrills but it wasnt all bad. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End wasnt the best horror movie ever but its not even the worst because the movie does have enough to keep you entertained and the death scenes were very creative especially at the start when the girl was cut in half vertically. There were some scenes that might have made me vomit if I was eating when the freaky mother was giving birth to an unadorable & extremely ugly baby. The other scene was when the freaky family was forcing the girl to eat the human meat near the end. Dale the retired solider shouldnt of died because he was the hero of the picture and his death ruined the whole movie for me. The ending just made me laugh when the stupid looking baby was given a severed finger to suck.,6.0,4531
Icy_Nostradamus," Gruesome,Gory,and Gross!What's not to love???",This is a DTV sequel to the 2003 film Wrong Turn.The film revolves around a group of young adults that participate in survival-like challenges as if the world was ending and deformed humans were roaming.Nowas I really dislike DTV sequels I must say this is a good sequel.Its better than the first Wrong Turn.This film has the 3 essentials to score big on my scale GruesomeGoreand Gross.This movie really was good enough to have the 3 essentials from my scale! The acting is good and the actors were great looking and always on cue.The violence it displays is used at times when it needs.The gore is used at the best times and its just flat out gross!thats why I love it!

The ""game"" is a simulated post-apocalyptic event where six contestants are challenged to survive a wooded wasteland in West Virginia.

More blood more guts than the 2003 original. Outstanding F/X. The movie opens with the unbelievable sequence of a contestant-to-be(Kimberly Caldwell)split in half from head to ""you know"" the nether region. Disturbing images are just that. Gore deluxe.

GirishGowda, Who Wants To Spend A Day With The West Virginia Monsters?,I rented Wrong Turn 1 & 2 a couple of nights ago as I am a huge fan of horror films and I thought that it wouldnt hurt to watch this even though I didnt know anything about the films. I liked the first one so I continued to watch the second movie. I definitely thought that the second film would be trash compared to the first as it is kind of how sequels in horror films generally are. Boy was I wrong! Wrong Turn 2: Dead End has gratuitous amount of blood and entertainment. It is fun and gory and definitely a sequel which is better than its predecessor. Also you dont even have to know anything about the first film to get it. Now that is a bonus which many sequels dont have.A group is about to film a survival TV series in the middle of the woods of West Virginia. The show is called Apocalypse where they have to think that the world as they knew it has ended and they are the only survivors and whoever wins will take home 100000$. Things take a wrong turn for the worst when the contestants are attacked by the hillbilly monster cannibals who survive by eating humans as the chemical waste has destroyed all the wildlife. So now the contestants are really trying to save their skins from becoming dinner for the monster family.The monster family reminds of some film or show I saw back when I was in school I just cant place my finger on what it was. But that is very haunting and eerie for me. Anyway the acting overall was good and the screenplay is exciting awesome and captures your full attention. I was so impressed with how cool this sequel was and this is a film which wont let your hopes down. The monsters from the first movie (whom I thought were dead and only had 3 monsters in total) now actually have a large family which also has a teenager who drops his pants to get down to business when he sees a hot girl. Also they have women who give birth to horrible monstrous disfigured babies. This film gave us a kind of understanding of their world and why they hunted people. The performance by the colonel was also great and this set-up gave more authenticity to some of the things the characters did. All the actors did such a great job that I didnt feel like I was watching a movie and all of this was fake. Giving more screen time to the monsters was a good idea and the climax is also very believable. I hope they make the third movie soon (hopefully it will be as entertaining as this) and I pray no monsters come to get me when I am going in to the woods. :) 8/10,8.0,4534
groovymike_16, A Direct-to-DVD sequel with the quality of a theatrical release...,"I saw the first ""Wrong Turn"" its opening weekend in theaters back in 2003. It was a very entertaining and fast-paced (granted it was only 81 minutes long) thrill-ride that rarely let up until the credits rolled. I wanted to see a sequel all along but a Direct-to-DVD one wasnt what I had in mind. So yeah when I heard about this being a Direct-to-DVD sequel with a plot about reality show contestants no less I was expecting it to be entertaining crap at best. But once the movie was wrapped and people were able to see screenings of it surprisingly positive things were actually being said about it. Some were even saying it was better than the original. How could that be? Were these people that just didnt like the original and found it easy to surpass? I didnt see how a Direct-to-DVD sequel with a plot I wasnt very thrilled about could manage the feat of being better than the first. But after reading mostly encouraging reviews for it I began to think that maybe this really would be good.Were the reviews right or were my fears realized? Well I must say Im very happy to report that this was a shockingly good sequel with the quality of a theatrical release. It really did deserve to be released in theaters. After a killer opening with a nice death scene the movie does slow down a bit to set-up the storyline with the reality show contestants but soon after it gets going and is an exciting gore-filled time. I was really impressed. This is actually a very worthy follow-up to the first movie and in some ways it actually surpasses it. Im kind of surprised they even managed to make this movie for as cheap as they did. If this cost only 4 Million then where the hell did the almost 13 Million spent on the original go? I sure cant figure it out.Im not too sure what to say about the actual movie. This is one where I really dont have many comments about the events in it. I just had a really good time and I enjoyed Erica Leerhsen (Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  2003) in it. Her character Nina was my favorite and the most interesting. Aside from her character the only others I liked were Amber Mara Jake and especially Dale (played by Henry Rollins in a pretty cool role).The major problem I have with most of the endless line of Direct-to-DVD sequels being released is that the majority of them just copy the plots from the previous films. Some even annoyingly feature the exact same type of scenes that were in the original with the exact same thing happening to another character. Thankfully ""Wrong Turn 2"" is none of this. This is a perfect example of a Direct-to-DVD sequel with its own idea. I wish the quality of others could be this good.Since this is going to be a profitable title for Fox you can bet well see a third entry sometime in the future. But advice to them; keep the same writer and director. Such an impressive job was done with this one that bringing in someone else could just screw up what is so far an enjoyable series. I will be disappointed if the next one has all new filmmakers. I trust that with them and another new plot (one different than the previous two) they will deliver another winner.Grade: 8/10 (B+)",8.0,4535
justind-5," This movie rocked, look out hostel and saw franchises!",Forget about saw and hostel movies wrong turn 2 is completely depraved sick gory as all hell and has enough unpredictable turns to make it a must see for all horror fans. The hillbillys are trulyspectacularly deranged and are exactly what I would imagine some of the inbred ferals to look like if they were poisoned with deformation chemicals! The gore in this movie is superb if your into that stuff. You have an arrow through to heads and through the eye of the other. An axe going straight down he middle of a cute blonde and her intestines left on the ground. A scene with a girl face down in a stream being slashed behind by a hillbilly until her back bone is visible. And on and on and on a great mix of disgusting gore. Although I must admit I enjoyed the first wrong turn more than this purely because it was more suspenseful and less gory but this one I think they made especial attention to the gore o meter. ALl the talk is about the likes of saw and hostel devils rejects etc. but this movie is sick to the mother effing bone with some of the nastiest kills Ive seen in some time. Go watch it if your a horror lover now!,9.0,4536
hu675, Probably one of the best Direct to Videos ever made.,"Dale (Herny Rollins) is the host of a TV Reality Show titled ""Apocalyspe"". Which Dale the director (Matthew Currie Holmes) and the producer (Aleksa Palladino) are choosing six different contestants (Erica Leerhsen Texas Battle Daniella Alonso Steve Braun Crystal Lowe and Kimberly Caldwell) to play a ""Survivor"" type-game but they find themselves battling a ugly bunch of inbred cannibals. Which these ""freaks"" are planning to kill them off one by one.Directed by Joe Lynch made an agreeable sequel to the cult horror favorite ""Wrong Turn"". Which the original wasnt much of a success in theaters but it went on to do well on DVD. The cast seems to be having a great time here the gore effects are well-done but the inbred looking cannibals are not as successful as Four-Time Oscar Winner:Stan Winstons original make-up design on the original.The Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes two commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director actors:Leerhsen & Rollins. Commentary two is by the screenwriters:Turi Meyer and Al Stepien. Which the writers are best-known for writing B-Movie scripts like ""Candyman:Day of the Dead"" ""Leprechaun 2"" and ""Sleepstalker"". DVD also includes two featurettes a small brief behind the scenes of the infamous ""incestous"" cannibals love scene and a trailer. This ""Direct to Video"" Sequel DVD is better than expected a few flaws here and there but nothing serious. Fans of the original will probably enjoy this one more. Wayne Robson as the mysterious old-timer is back in the sequel. ""Three Fingers"" Character from the original is played by a different actor here. The lead cannibal ""Pa"" is played by Ken Kirzinger.

stuarttrueson, Very entertaining gore-horror,The strongest installment in the series and very entertaining. Henry Rollins is very good and there is lots of gore. The story works well and I am interested all through. In my opinion ratings need to be based on expectations and what you want from a film of the genre and type you are watching.Blade Runner Dumb Dumber Dr Strangelove and Golden Eye can not and should not be rated on the same premises.This film is not a Texas Chainsaw Massacre - even if it has similarities - but it does not try to be. It is fun.,9.0,4538
sithrobin," Yes, this was entertaining! and nothing more","When seeing wrong turn was out I already knew what to expect; Yes the plot was non existent Yes Almost all actors are not even soap opera worthy Yes it was predictable Yes The dialog the storyline and characters are a clichéSo with that in mind i sat down on the couch grabbed a coke and a popcorn and was actually entertained by this movie; a simple slice and dice no brainer.

alternate-dan, Wrong Turn 2 makes a Bloody Right Turn,"To start this I would like to say that this movie cheered me up made me grab my mouth and cracked me up while still being scared.Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a movie I highly recommend for a ""Slasher"" fan. It delivers all we want; The bitchy goth chick (Erica Leershen - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake) the token black guy (Texas Battle - Final Destination 3) the tough army girl (Daniella Alonso - The Hills Have Eyes 2 the slutty bitch (Crystal Lowe - Black Christmas remake)the joker (Steve Braun - Harold and Kumar go to White Castle) the diva celebrity as herself (Kimberly Caldwell - TVs American Idol) plane Jane boyfriend the cameraman and the lovely angry but fun previous soldier whos now hosting Reality TV (Henry Rollins - Feast). We can say that the stereotypes are cliché but they actually work and fit perfectly.Little can I say but the inbred cannibals were amazing and not to mention brutal. They were this family just like us humans but only way more brutal disgusting and uglier. Although they did not top the original inbreds but at least we got the survivor from the original Wrong Turn Three Finger to hunt more fresh meat.Cut to the directing. I couldnt believe that this movie was Joe Lynchs first. The directing was very good and did not seem first-time directing. I loved how he gave every important character their screen time to kind of root to them. However his sick little twisted mind really helped the film making it more violent brutal and disturbing.For every horror fans out there do not judge the film for its cheesy trailer or knowing it is a Direct to Video release because it is hell of an action-packed blood-splatter horror flick! (As for a DTV release this is highly one of the Best ones yet and the best horror sequel in a long time)So bring on Wrong Turn 3 and let Lynch be the director. He did a fantastic job on this one I count on him doing the same for a third installment.It gets 8 Stars out of 10 for being one hell of a slasher flick and for making a bloody right turn!",8.0,4540
mattressman_pdl, Say hello to the missus for me,Every now and then a sequel comes out that makes you proud to be a horror fan. This is that time. From first time director Joe Lynch comes Wrong Turn 2: Dead End the best direct to video film in quite a long time. Plot: Contenstants in a survival reality show find their skills put to the ultimate test when they come upon a pack of mutated inbred cannibals who are very very hungry. Highlights: Henry Rollins gets the role fans have been ready for him to play forever as Dale Murphy a Rambo for the new generation. The body count is terrific (one of the flaws of the original was the low body count) as blood guts and other unmentionable objects fly across the screen in a litany of grue and terror that should make any horror fan weep. Genre veterans Erica Leehrsen (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003) and Texas Battle (Final Destination 3) also bring their A-game. Lowpoints: Should have replaced Hills Have Eyes 2 in the theaters because as a straight to video sequel it could lose a share of their audience. Final Verdict: Horror fans check it out as a strong urging from a fellow genre appreciator. Plenty of gore nudity and suspense on display here.,9.0,4541
careybrandon-41144, More entertaining and gory than the last,A well made sequel still following our favorite backwoods inbred cannibals attacking a survival game show group. With great characters and even nastier goor than the last film. This is a solid sequel to the last Wrong Turn,8.0,4542
kluseba, Blood Is Thicker Than Water,Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is the sequel to the surprisingly successful first instalment released four years prior. The idea is still the same as the film follows a group of reality show contestants and organizers who get tracked down by inbred cannibals in the wilderness of West Virginia.The movie starts on a rather low note since the characters involved are particularly unlikable. Some examples include a former military who shows his muscles but not much brainpower a misogynistic loser who constantly makes dirty jokes and a superficial woman willing to give blowjobs in exchange for screen time. The first half hour is rather difficult to sit through.However the movie gets much better once the horror elements kick in. The surviving characters start getting more fleshed out and become more likable as well. The death and torture scenes are very brutal even by the genres standards and the rather modest budget. Especially the final scenes at an abandoned mill deep in the forest are among the franchises greatest moments. The film also offers some background information on the inbred cannibals as several characters from the first film make an appearance again. Its interesting that the cannibals are presented as a loyal family with strong ties in this instalment rather than just as creepy hillbillies as in the first film. The movie even has an environmental message that explains the villains atrocious malformations. The films final scene is particularly ugly and memorable in that regard. The films final hour gets better with every minute and will keep you on the edge of your seat.In the end Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is one of the few cases in cinematic history when a sequel is much better than the original film. Dont get fooled by the shallow opening thirty minutes that make you expect the worst. Once the introductions to all the characters are done the film quickens up the pace as the death scenes are much more brutal than those of the predecessor and the plot is less predictable and even shares some interesting background information and an environmental message. Fans of bloody slashers should certainly watch and appreciate this film and might want to check out the entire franchise for that matter.,8.0,4543
rarepeperonis, MTV,Its your average mid-2000 fast food college horror movie. Got all the tropes.Filmed like a MTV show with MTV like actors.I mean im a teen of that era so all these low budget horror flick who would end up on blockbuster shelves that no one would rent but me are close to my heart. Its not groundbreaking cinema it is what it is.Stereotypical teen group end up in stereotypical hillbilly woods with stereotypical cannibal monsters. The story could fit on a post-it and i dont mind.Really impressed by the amount of gore in this. Usually these movies were tamer but they went all in for this one. If you like pools of blood youll find em here.It is what it is i have kind of nostalgia for that era of fastfood horror flicks. Its not oscar worthy its Wrong Turn 2 lol.

loomis78-815-989034, Subtlety? What does that mean this film asks.,"Hey! What would be a better setting for a new Reality survival series than the heavy backwoods of West Virginia where the original Hillbilly cannibals from the first film killed everything in sight? A film crew and their actor contestants make this fatal choice and more hillbilly cannibals show up and kill them off. From the opening scene which has blond Hollywood contestant Kimberly (Kimberly Caldwell) being literally split in half down the middle; Director Joe Lynch sets out to make this sequel a gore fest that out does the original. Lynch does achieve his sick out goal of out doing the original in gore but he fails to deliver a superior film. The original ""Wrong Turn"" has some stomach turning moments for sure but it also delivered great suspense and some classic jump scares. The film also provided some characters that the audience liked and could pull for. This film offers Herny Rollins as an ex-military man doing his Rambo impersonation while the hapless actors and crew get easily killed and picked apart by the hillbillies. It takes a while but eventually the audience can get behind the characters of Nina (Leerhsen) and Jake (Battle) and that helps a bit since most of the characters here are very stereotyped. The acting and production value are good and the film looks good. Where Wrong Turn 2 makes its wrong turn is in its over the top attempt to gross out the audience. Yes its a horror film but the excessive gore becomes the entire point of the film and takes away from any true terror the film can manufacture. Its hard to tell if its intentional or not but there is a dining room scene the echoes the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Nina is being force fed human remains in a tasteless scene that is hard to watch. This isnt scary just disgusting. The filmmakers here would have benefited by watching Tobe Hoopers Texas diner scene and realize that what made it so terrifying was its style editing and suggestion. Wrong Turn 2 would have been a better film with some subtlety.",5.0,4545
acidburn-10, Good for a Straight To DVD sequel,"Normally I stay away from straight to DVD movies especially sequels because they are usually terrible and cheap looking and awful acting. But when I came across ""Wrong Turn 2"" I was actually eager to see it as I really liked the first one and I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. They really upped the ante with this one we get more deaths and more splatter which I really enjoyed. The storyline in this one we get a group of people filming a reality show which was rather fun and interesting and I could tell from the opening death a woman sliced in half is that this movie was gonna be awesome. I was a bit sceptical at the reality show setting as in the past when slasher movies have tried this they usually dont really work but in this it works to full effect and plus we get more inbred mutants to add to the fun. But there are a few drawbacks in this movie like firstly it does lack the tension and atmosphere the first movie had and instead opting for more blood splatter and gore and the fact that we see way too much of the mutants which did take away the overall terror and this movie was still fun and slick.The acting in this was actually not what I expected it was really good. Henry Rollins was fun as the ex-marine turning Rambo without being ridiculous. Erica Leerhsen really gives it her all and comes across as one of the more fleshed out characters in this movie and Texas Battle also really stood out and believable as he turns hero throughout the latter half of the movie. Daniella Alonso also gives a stand out performance as the female army soldier. Steve Braun plays the joker of pack pretty well Crystal Lowe was gorgeous playing the token slutty character but she played the part really well and I also enjoyed her in the (Black X-Mas remake) Aleksa Palladino made me really feel for her as the put upon plain girl whose treated like dirt and I felt sad when her time ended as she didnt get the opportunity to get her own back and Matthew Currie Holmes was extremely unlikeable and self absorbed but he did it well.All in all ""Wrong Turn 2"" is fun fast paced and slick all the right ingredients for a sequel its a pity that the further sequels doesnt follow suit.",7.0,4546
lastliberal-853-253708," Okay, from now on, you'll be the uptight lesbian sister I never had. Deal?","Whoa! Kimberly (Kimberly Caldwell) definitely didnt get an American Idol ticket to Hollywood as she makes a wrong turn on the way to a reality show and we get a gore treat that will blow your mind. This is in the first 10 minutes! Now I am telling you that this is they way those reality shows should be done. Put the contestants in the woods with incredibly ugly mutant cannibals and see who makes it out. Id be a regular viewer.People are dropping like flies and soon there are just a few left: Nina (Erica Leerhsen) Amber (Daniella Alonso) Jake (Texas Battle - ""The Bold and the Beautiful"") Jonsey (Steve Braun) and Dale (Henry Rollins). Blood is flowing from arrows and axes knives. It really gets gross at times so this is not for the faint of heart.Dale gets all Rambo with war paint and weapons. There are only two left for him to save.The ending was raw! I cannot imagine what they will come up with in Wrong Turn 3.",7.0,4547
ConnorMonteith, One of the best horror sequels I've seen in a long time,"This film is definitely more successful than the first one. This film is full of horror suspense and a great thriller to watch. The story is very well written and the events within it are ordered in a professional manner. The film revolves around a TV show which is situated in the woods. Straight from the beginning as soon as you see the woods you can tell something thrilling is to come. The TV show turns into a race to escape the cannibals - but only those still alive.This film could easily compare to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""My Bloody Valentine"". These films are not exactly the same but the plots and characteristics are common in each individual film.I thought the film was fantastic to a point before it started going slightly downhill. We have all seen different variables of genetically deformed cannibals before but this film managed to keep me entertained right through from start to end. It has more gore than the previous one and of course this 4 year advancement gives the film better effects making it exciting. Personally I would recommend this film to anyone who loves cruel gore and a bit of suspense. Overall its a great watch and shouldnt be missed.8/10",5.0,4548
ksaluzzo," Awesome sequel, better than the first!",Wrong Turn was a pretty original and interesting film back from 2003 which starred the lovely Desmond Harrington and the even lovelier Eliza Dushku and was about a group of people who start getting killed-of by a group of hillbilly mutants in a very gross way. Wrong Turn 2 takes the premise a lot further and centers around 6 (wouldve been 7 if a blond girl wasnt brutally killed in the opening scene) interesting reality show contestants who are all trying to win a certain sum of money but soon they get killed of by the hillbillies again. We have the bitchy likable heroine (the gorgeous and talented Erica Leerhsen) ex-jock (Texas Battle) likable producer (Aleksa Palladino) skater boy (Steve Braun) gay army girl (Daniella Alonso) and the... um slut (Crystal Lowe). Now these characters are all stereotypical yet you feel bad for them when they die and they die in such funny and gory scary moments you just have to like this film! I really liked this sequel (more than the first) and I thought the family was very scary and greatly done. The acting was great too and all actors do a good job here (yes even the slut) but I thought Erica Leerhsen was the best actor in the movie and despite her character isnt a typical heroine you want to see her live. The director did a really good job too and the deaths are really effective as I already said so I think if you love scary bloody horror films Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is the best movie you could ever choose. Blood guts great acting and more! Brilliant sequel finally one better than its original and Im very impressed with it! Check this one out!,10.0,4549
movieman89-2, Wrong Turn 2 the gutter,"I really enjoyed the first movie. When watching this I thought what a waste of film. The first 5 minutes I said to myself ""Im in for a bad film"" I was felt like I was right.The plot just went over the same thing over again. The acting was laughable and appalling. Most of the characters you just end up hating with no connection.The make up scenes  you could easily tell that they are fake. The gore went way over the top and was ridiculous. How could one single blow to the head with an axe chop all of you in half. How could slashing someones back a couple of times show the spine seriously its that bad.I thought there were too many inbred scenes and two incest scenes which I thought was unnecessary. I thought to myself ""I really didnt need to see that"".Some of the filming looked like a filming mistake but felt like to add it in anyway which was rubbish. There were shots that were blurred and you couldnt tell what was going on.I recommend you the first one. I would really avoid this to save money and time.",1.0,4550
film_maniac2500, Violent - Unpredictable - Suspenseful,The best direct-to-DVD franchise movie ever? Id say so. With the new trend of releasing sequels straight to DVD (Ill Always Know What You Did Last Summer Return to House on Haunted Hill) Wrong Turn 2 surpasses all my expectations. It has interesting characters loads of suspense and great death scenes. Despite the low budget the film even manages to better the first film.Dont get me wrong the film has its faults but they can easily be overlooked when a movie which with its budget shouldnt be good turns out to be one of the best horror films of 2007.Definitely worth renting.,8.0,4551
laraibkhan-29129, The Scariest movie ever made !!!,This movie is really a great horror movie. Ive never seen such a scary movie before. Its very entertaining movie as well unlike the boring supernatural horror movies which are not really scary. I enjoyed each and every scene of it. This sequel is the most violent one in the entire wrong turn series. Its totally my type of movie because i love those horror movies which make me scary. Amazing direction by Joe Lynch. All the characters were really very good. Much better than my expectations. Overall its an excellent movie very very very violent. Strongly recommended for the lovers of horror movies. P.S. Dont watch it if you have a weak heart.,10.0,4552
Sci-FiHorrorFan, A Great sequel!.,"This movie was pretty good and i liked iti found it just as good as the original film and just as entertaining. This film may not be as serious or as dark as the original film but it still works very well because like the original you have some likable characters and a great location and some good cinematography and you also get some suspenseful scenes that work very well. now granted not all of the characters are likable you do get your cliché characters like the rude girl and the cheating boyfriend typebut most of the characters were likable.I liked Hennry Rollins in the film i thought he was a Badass and he was fun to watchand if people are a fan of the guy then i would definitely recommend you to watch this film because Hennry Rollins kicks a lot of ass in this film and beats up a lot of The hillbillies. What i also liked about this film was that it was unpredictable because you didnt know who would live and who would die and that made the film different and more exciting because you never saw anything comingmaybe you think you do but then the complete opposite happens and you get a big surprise and thats another reason im giving this film some praise because the people who i thought would die lived and the people i thought would live died and it was very surprising.This film has a lot of twists and turns and it had some good ideas and creativity which i liked and i liked the idea of the simulated post apocalyptic reality show that the characters were involved in i thought it was a fun idea and it made the film different which is a good thing in a horror movie and thats why this film worked because the formula changed a little bit because of certain things like the ""unpredictability"" and the twists and turns and of course the cool idea of the simulated reality show. of course things go wrong and people end up getting killed one by one just like the previous film but here it was done differently and some of the kills were quite creative and very Gory so if people are gore fans they might like this film.I thought three finger was one creepy son of a Bitch in this film! he was just as creepy here as he was in the first film and i thought the actor that played three finger did a really good Job and for some reason ive always found him the creepiest out of all the cannibals i dont know why but there is just something freakish and weird about him that makes him stand out from the others. I thought the make up effects of the cannibal hillbillies looked very good and they all looked very menacing and scary.As for the characters in the film i have to say there were a lot of them i liked which surprised me because usually most horror films dont have many likable characters in them but this did.I liked Erica Leerhsen in the film i thought she was very pretty and i think shes quite a good Actress she certainly did well in this film. I will admit that i was a bit off about her character at first because she seemed a bit distant and moody toward everyone but as the film went on her character Grew on me and i did end up liking her. I also liked the friendship she formed with Texas Battle Whos characters name is Jakei thought he also did good in the film i thought he played his role well and i thought his acting was above average. I also liked Steve Braun and Daniella Alonso in the film i thought those two were very likable and i found them both very funny at times.their characters made me laugh my head off! and i loved their back and forth Dialog with each other and i liked the friendship that developed with them because at first they didnt really like each other but then they ended up getting along which i thought was nice and another reason i liked their characters was they helped each other outthey didnt just leave each other so when the guy got caught in a trap in the woods the girl tried to help himshe was a true (friend) to him she didnt just run away and leave him she stayed with him and tried to (help) him and that made her character likable and these are the kind of characters i like in a movie characters that (help each other) not characters that are A**holes and dont care about anyone.thats why this film works because nearly everyone is likable.I also liked Aleksa Palladino in the film i thought her acting was good and i thought her character was sweet and quite nice.so six of the characters i liked but the others did nothing for me and i didnt really care about them. maybe if the others were written better i would have found them more intriguing but there were a total of six characters i liked and thought did good in their acting and as i said before Hennry Rollins kicks ass! and that reason alone is good enough to watch this film!.you get good action good blood and gore and good kills and the film never gets boring because it has so much action and i liked our two lead actors Texas and Erica i thought they played good and interesting Characters and i liked the rolls they played and the film also had a great unexpected final which i enjoyed and thought was intense. All in all this is a Very good film and its worth buying!.",10.0,4553
iansmom99, Disgustingly mediocre,"First of all I LOVE the Wrong Turn trilogy. The original was a very decent slasher movie. However Wrong Turn 2 goes waaaaaaayyyyyyyy over the top. The gore and blood effects are so ridiculously stupid. Even worse the movie takes place during the daytime. You cant make a horror movie scary without it taking place at night. I know its been done before but Wrong Turn 2 doing that. It does NOT work. The thing I hated the most was there were moments where the mutants engaged in ""sexual activity"". That was extremely gross and sick. I wish those parts were deleted. Now dont get me wrong this movie was fun to watch. The acting is great and and there were a few surprises. The only cool thing about Wrong Turn 2 is watching Henry Rollins as retired marine Dale Murphy kicking mutant ass.",4.0,4554
Gefafwisp," Complete and total rubbish, as expected.","Honestly who sits down and writes this sh*te?? Why would anyone think its good idea to make a crap sequel for an already established crap film?? Wrong turn was poor but it looks like a modern horror masterpiece in comparison.Sod all atmosphere sod all tension the depthless characters are totally expendable - youll never give a damn if they die or not the ""inbreeds"" look ridiculous and unconvincing the film has borrowed numerous ideas from great horror films and utilized them to absolutely no effect and once the violence becomes over-gratuitous (which is the first 4 minutes) like any movie it becomes boring and about as scary as a blind puppy with no teeth. Oh dear.Predictable direction predictable plot predictable ending. Clearly made for the money alone. If you like watching pointless people dying in various different largely predictable ways youll love this crap. The rest of you who are looking for an ACTUAL horror movie only watch this if you feel like having a good laugh before getting depressed about the amount of this kind of sh*te thats soullessly churned out year after year. Oh and the acting is w**k too.",2.0,4555
obistrike, Get those Dudes a Mop! More bang for your buck,Now I enjoyed the first one the girl was cute the rednecks were freaky but all in all it was a relatively simply low key Hollywood horror that pushed a few buttons and kept me entertained.I hoped a sequel would come on paper it looked promising; a first time director larger cast lower budget big papa Rollins to ham it up someone called Texas battle and its about a reality TV show...OK on paper it looked a tad dodgy but forget all that these guys have made a sterling effort to give horror fans what they want Its got it all really the effects are spot on for the cash paid to make them Henry Rollins is the man Ive never seen someone take apart the locals so effectively the supporting cast adds humour and booty aplenty.Give a first timer a couple of million quid 20 unknowns 3 cameras a forest an effects guy and a month to make something entertaining and you cant expect much better in my opinion.Good job 7/10,7.0,4556
disdressed12, this movie is Wrong..on so many levels,wow.this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time.the disgust factor is way too high in this one.i think they were going for the cheap gross out to try to shock the viewer.for meall they succeeded in was making me nearly lose my lunch.the plot in this one is wafer thineven for this type of movie.id say it was a horror moviebut its more of a splatter fest than anything else.i dont mind gore and graphic violence in a movieif there is a point to it.but to methere was no point for this level of disgust.the effects and makeup are not done very well herein my opinion.the first Wrong Turn movie was entertaining with interesting characters and some semblance of a plot.and it wasnt as unnecessarily disgusting.Wrong Turn 2 isnt even close to being in the same league.Henry Rollins is the only saving grace to this movie.as a resulti give Wrong Turn 2:Dead End a reluctant 2/10,2.0,4557
WadeVC-1, A Great Movie...if you have low expectations.,Ho-hum...it never amazes me to see just how little substance and just how thin plots can be in movies anymore. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is just another in a long line of maximum gore and minimal quality that seems to have plagued the horror movie genre. If you have an affinity for buckets of blood guts and gore; but very little else then this movie will be right up your alley.Oddly enough the best acting to be found in this film is not from a trained actor but a singer: Henry Rollins. Henry is the only person in this movie that brought a true believability to his role and played it extremely well. Unfortunately his character was short-lived meeting a demise very early into the film.I find it amusing that with all the high-tech SFX and camera work that went into this destined-for-the-bargain-bin movie that the one shining star of the film came from someone (Rollins) whose profession is far removed from the big screen.If you like Henry Rollins then you will like this film and his performance. If you like a quality movie with an equally crafted script you may want to pass on this one.,3.0,4558
gregsrants, Gorefest!,When Wrong Turn was released in May of 2003 I went to the box office on opening day and sat through 90 so minutes of hillbilly gross-out. The film starred one hot Eilza Dushku (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and reminded me of a cross between The Hills Have Eyes and Deliverance  The Lost Tapes. The film had a group of five good looking young victims falling prey to hillbilly cannibals that have become disfigured likely due to their notions of whetting their sexual appetites with kin (or was it toxic waste  I cant remember). Wrong Turn was a disappointment at the domestic box office taking in only $15 million in receipts and although DVD rentals and sales proved to recoup the films production budget I dont think many were thinking sequel at the time.Maybe that is why it took some four years before Wrong Turn 2  Dead End hit the rental store shelves. But alas here we are in 2007 and to my enjoyment an unrated version of the sequel was now available for me to bring home for 48 hours for only $5.79. Wrong Turn 2 is directed by Joe Lynch who makes his directorial debut and does as good a job as any veteran of the genre with the material he has been given. In the sequel another group of five are left in the forests of West Virginia as part of a reality survival program called The Ultimate Survivalist : Apocalypse (yeah I know). With just them the small production crew and the host (Henry Rollins who you will all watch and wonder where have I seen that guy before?) all alone in the dense forested area they are easy fodder for the family of deformed hillbillies that will stock murder kill and cook these poor unsuspecting victims. One by one or two at a time they are hunted down like deer and killed in some of the most gruesome methods this side of Hostel. Oh did I mention it was most gruesome? These chaps are hunted down in ways that will leave your hand out of the popcorn box for fear of regurgitating the kernels. If you thought The Hills Have Eyes 2 was over the top you aint seen nothing yet. Right from the first victim who ends up with a split personality you get the full value of the words un-rated that appear on the DVD box cover.Wrong Turn 2 is like taking The Hills Have Eyes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and even a bit of Rambo and throws them in a blender with your favorite pet. It is a relentless parade of blood and gore that might be short on scares but certainly not on the fake blood that splattered across my big screen so frequently that the room was aglow of red for most of the second half. When not in kill mode we still have unsettling scenes like the ode of Chainsaw where the family has a guest over for dinner and serves fellow contestants as appetizers. Amazingly shot in only 25 days Lynch keeps the pace moving and the body count mounting as one should of a movie that consists of hillbilly maneaters. If you are looking for a film that piles on the gore then I doubt you can do much better than this  well that is until Saw 4 comes out around Halloween.I am not giving a full recommendation to the film. Although I got what I wanted from the release I was thankful I didnt set aside a Saturday evening and strap in with my friends and go to the theatre and pay top dollar for the flick. Especially if I went after dinner. www.robertsreviews.com www.killerreviews.com,6.0,4559
prolelol, Absolutely good! Love it.,Wrong Turn 2 was one of my first horror films when I was 12 years old or something and it genuinely terrified me while watching it and that I had to sleep a few nights with light on. So I finally gave it a second viewing after a few years. Its still an entertaining brilliant terrifying and gory movie. The opening scene is still damn good and it got the best kill in Wrong Turn series no doubt. I honestly loved all cannibals in it they were actually very entertaining characters and wearing awesome makeups which were better than from the original. I also loved the characters as well I was glad some of the characters ended up being survivals. It has awful CGI but I couldnt less care because it made this movie memorable. The last 20 minutes was so fun to watch. Its no better than the original while that one is a classic but I just love it so much.,10.0,4560
eric_ccj77, Awesome watch,If you love blood and gore. This is the film to watch. I love the series and this film delivers the gore. Great twists. Thinking oh she will survive when she doesnt. Great killing scenes. Love it,10.0,4561
adamscastlevania2," The first half nearly kills it, but the second just about saves it",(48%) A decent yet still very much a mixed bag of blood guts and cretins. Once the over-the-top opening sequence featuring a death that wouldnt be out of place in a Mortal Kombat video game this takes a nose dive once the reality TV aspect comes into play and this becomes both dull (just like real reality TV) and more abundantly poorly written and acted; although this does start to heat up quite nicely once the redneck mutants get in the picture more. The gore levels here are quite high the hillbilly barbecue scenes in particular are somewhat stomach turning and once this gets going towards the end the crappy junk TV elements are forgotten and this is as entertaining as any of the better horror B-movies. It may not have an original bone in its body but this despite a poor first half is worth a look for gore fans.,5.0,4562
nathaniel22-25-349001, Just like the first one...Way underrated!!!,This movie is definitely not as good as the first one and has some flaws but the gore the action and the tense sequences are there. The cast is pretty good and the special effects as well but this one decided to forget the fist movie and create the whole new cannibal family which is fine but the kids are kind of annoying and the abundant amount of sex shouldnt be there... Some kills are great and the production values amazing. These are the kind of sequels we should get with movies... And as I stated I think the first and second Wrong Turn movies are way underrated...seriously 6.1 and 5.5 out of 10??? Anyway I really love these two and you should probably give them a try! Also I dont think there should of been other sequels after this one...,8.0,4563
boris_kolarov, Not a bad movie,I liked the movie. There was some jump scares and many blood. I liked the beginning because the victim was slain to half. Also I liked how the cannibal family was looking. My favorite character was Amber the Iraq veteran. Oh why she needed to die?Anyway I hate Elena the girl who was having sex with the boyfriend of a other woman in the competition. In the movie there was more blood than in the previous movie. The end was cool - one cannibal gives the little cannibal baby a finger like a pacifier. That made me laugh. So the movie is not the best but it is still cool with the big amount blood.,10.0,4564
xhayleecx, okay :),Okay so when I seen this movie showing on television the first thing I thought was OH NO! not another boring sequel ruining a perfectly good Movie Anyways I left the movie on and I was pleasantly surprised So it werent as good as the first one but what sequel is?? I think they gave the hillbilly in-breads a little too much character and it got a little silly with them but thats the only criticism I really have there was Good horror gore and an actual story to this unlike other disappointing sequels what would have been good though if the surviving characters from the original movie had made an appearance but all the actors were very good not over the top or trying to hard all in all I would have to say I enjoyed it!!!,7.0,4565
ian_bell, This whole film is a complete Dead End,Wrong Turn 2 has probably the most apt film title of the year. Dead End. That just about says it all. How this film ever got out of the block I will never know.The original Wrong Turn from 2003 was a genuinely atmospheric horror with both suspense and characters to the fore. You can tell just how bad WT2 is by the fact that the first grisly murder takes place within five minutes of the film starting.We are then plunged into the middle of a reality TV show involving six - or is it seven? - celebrities. Henry Rollins pops up as a US Marine brought in to kick ass while the various celebrities bicker and squabble as they are paired off and then go off into the woods to see if they can survive more than half-an-hour without a Mars bars a mobile phone or a roll of toilet paper.So far so good and I will admit I did almost enjoy the first thirty minutes. But boy once the mutants appear the film goes downhill faster than an episode of Dallas. The director was presumably trying to explore the mythology of this mutant race by showing them up close and personal but take it from me with people this ugly thats really not a good idea. There may also have been a bit of subtext about not judging others by their appearance but again given that the villains were so utterly repulsive any message about not judging others on their looks is sort of lost as you reach in desperation for the sick bucket.One of the more laughable scenes in the film involves Crystal Lowe trying to seduce a contestant down by the lake. Suggesting to the said contestant that he have sex with her on camera the lovely Ms Lowe takes her top off to give the film its obligatory nude scene. But standing with her boobs on show is not the turn-on she hoped. Stunned when the object of her desire - the improbably named Texas Battle - rebuffs her advances Crystal is further shocked to hear that the mans mother and six nieces would not approve of such behaviour. At this point you get the feeling Mr Battle is probably in the wrong movie.As things get steadily worse we are subjected to some ludicrous so-called death scenes as one by one the contestants meet a grisly end. In a film this bad a sense of humour can often be a saving grace but unfortunately the script does not allow for it. The director it seems was going all out for blood and gore but sadly all he ended up doing with is reviewer was provoking utter boredom.My advice? - Watch the highly rated original then forget they ever made a sequel. Youll thank me for it one day.,3.0,4566
atinder, Great movie,The Wrong Turn 2 is one of the best horror movies to come out this year.Its much more gory then the first and it a sham that it went straight to DVD.It starts of with a really good gory death and the worst part of movie is when they are introducing teens and some will find the acting a bit goofy at times.but most of time the acting is really good this movie is full of blood and action packed until the end I think this as to the goriest movie of the year.The only downside was Hillbilly Cannibals they wear no were near as scary as first but they are still a little creepy.If you liked the first movie you will love this Without a doubt.One of the best horror sequel in years.9/10,9.0,4567
kyleallen_9, White Knuckle Flick Kicks Major Ass,Let me start by saying you have to be a die hard horror fan and gore fan to be able to sit through this chaotic gore-fest. I loved the first one so I was hoping that the sequel would kick ass and it did. Great cast members as well Erica Leerhsen(The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Blair Witch 2) Henry Rollins(The Henry Rollins Show) Kimberly Caldwell(American Idol and TV Guide Hostess) Texas Battle(Final Destination 3 and One Tree Hill) Daniella Alonso(Hills Have Eyes 2 and One Tree Hill) Aleksa Palladino Crystal Lowe(Black Christmas and Final Destination 3) Steve Braun and others had to fight a family of hideously deformed maniacs who hunt them through the wilderness and are determined to kill them all. This movie is a die hard cannibal gore-fest so a word of caution before you decide to watch it. It kicks ass!!,10.0,4568
dschmeding," 10point opening, 1point ending","I was not too interested in watching this after the disaster they made of the ""hills have eyes"" sequel. Anyway I liked Part 1 of Wrong Turn and many people told me positive things about it. Now with an opening sequence like this one (believe me... this one rocks big time and already makes for 4 of my 6 points) my doubts were swept aside. Wrong Turn 2 has many things positive in the script... for one its a take on modern media an game shows (which is not new but surely adds to the thousandth regurgitation of the hillbilly subject) and it has Henry Rollins as a Rambo-like army guy who now earns his money with cheap game shows. The story is set in the same woods as the first part where a pilot for a survival reality show is shot with the contestants running around and trying to survive after the nuclear apocalypse. Now the first contestant dies gloriously in he opening sequence and other follow soon. The kills are not as catchy as the opener but it keeps your attention. Also the whole back story of the mutated inbreds is given this time. Although the movie is decent horror entertainment it slides kind of downhill and towards the end loads of illogical things happen... my favorite one is the machine where the inbreds smash their food in... thats a real ridiculous idea and the second its introduced you know why. The gore flows and splatters in high doses when people explode hillbillys get smashed and blonde chicks torn in half. Beside the holes in the plot and several ridiculous scenes he acting of several of the characters was kind of bad and clichéd... and the ending once again made me sigh. This is another bad one that makes me wonder if its a comedy or just a lobotomized script writer. If you want a decent load of gore screwing hillbilly mutants good ole monster family fun like in TCM2 and the best ""chopped in half"" scene in film history... watch this but bring a six pack and dont be too sober to follow the lame plot.",6.0,4569
gavintaylor50, A awesome film.,Wrong turn 2 for me was great the violence wasnt disappointing and the actors werent TOO bad. The film is about 6 reality stars who go on a reality show for a 100000 dollared prize but there are cannibals who are very hungry. The film opening is great Kimberly doesnt do very well before she is easily killed gruesomely. The other characters are: Nina (Gothic girl) Jake (Jockey) Dale (Ex marine) Amber (Marine) Elena (Slut) Jonesy (Skater) Mara (Average girl) M (Maras boyfriend). All the characters are obvious ones they all play a certain role and you get to know them pretty well. Surprisingly Mara is killed of pretty quick getting an axe to the head The slut is then killed after flashing her boobs for a few seconds she is then killed by the cannibal sister being stabbed several times in the back in a lake revealing her spine (not nice). Amber and Jonesy are killed together Dale sadly is killed gruesomely and M is killed (no-one cares about him though as he cheats on Mara with Elena).Altogether the film is pretty good and i recommend it.,9.0,4570
Danny_G13," Insane levels of gore, but surprisingly fun",Teen slasher flick sequel manages to engage rather than bore despite a fairly thin plot.APOCALYPSE! Its the new reality TV show where contestants compete for a £100k prize in the scenario of them being the last 7 people alive on earth including the shows macho host.What these poor blighters dont know is the forest zone theyre filming in is inhabited by more of the hideously deformed mutations as proudly adorning the original movie. Inbreeding has been going on again and once again these freaks hunt humans and eat them.So what starts out as a fun reality game soon becomes a fight for survival against deformed cannibal psychos.And this is where the games begin; by God this movie is gory! I dont think Ive seen more blood and guts in a film in my life - and some of the violence and carnage is way beyond the Saw movies. This is true gore horror at its finest. Sure some bits look a little dodgy and not wholly convincing but others look great and truly make your toenails curl.The makeup on the mutations isnt all that bad either managing to look decently hideous.And the plot is as deep as it needs to be - it is aided by fast and exciting direction which makes the movie feel shorter than it is.As long as you are ready for an inordinate amount of gore you will get a real kick out of this.,7.0,4571
cjvelasquez, Fantastic Sequel!,This was a great action filled sequel. The film never ceases to be entertaining from start to finish. Anybody that is a fan of horror movies will very much be pleased with this movie. The acting is solid and the plot is superb. I was very impressed by how the film takes the concept of reality television and incorporates it nicely into the horror genre. I would also like to comment that the special effects are great for a film of its budget. The scene locations throughout the film also add greatly towards the terrifying feel that the film gives. Being a couple of years since the release of the first Wrong Turn movie made me unsure as to how similar this movie would be to the original. I quickly learned that this film was a great sequel to the first movie.,8.0,4572
hello_goodbye_01, uhmm nice attempt....not bad.,Sequels normally suck and i had very very low expectations when i borrowed this movie. Surprisingly it was actually OK for a sequel the acting was somewhat mediocre but still bearable. This was a nice attempt but still very poorly made. Sorry but Henry Rollins made this movie suck so bad we dont need freaking muscular dumb heroes to save our days and it made the movie cheesier than it already is. The gore is WAY over done to the point it got ridiculous. The opening scene is the worst part in my opinion...i mean sure its a movie but couldnt they have put more effort to make that scene a little better? Overall it was uhmm OK...the first is still much better and scarier.,5.0,4573
jhpstrydom, It surpasses the original in every respect,Wrong turn 2: dead end was a huge surprise considering it was released direct to video the first one was a big favorite among me and my friends and then came the second one it was such a big hit with everyone we found it hard to believe it was direct to video it was everything you would want from mainstream horror films it was more scary had impressive gore effects and had likable and dislikable characters and a film like the hills have eyes 2 goes to theaters and doesnt come within ten feet of this filmOverall set your expectations high this film delivers far above the standards of many of 2007 mainstream horror films.9 out of 10,9.0,4574
dustinhunter707," Entertaining and gory, but some scenes were inappropriate",OK now I sort of liked this movie it was a gory horror sequel to a good horror movie. I loved the strong horror violence and gore but some scenes were just really disturbing and im talking about some of the scenes in this film that involve the inbred cannibals in sexual situations that absolutely no one would ever care to see not even the sickest people on the planet. Henry Rollins did a good job as the ex-marine who would stop at nothing to take down the psychos and Erica Leerhsen did a good job too. I give this one a 7 out of 10 because it was good but it could have done without some of the scenes that I was discussing up above. I would recommend this film to all horror movie fans but I wouldnt recommend it to those who are disturbed or sickened easily definitely not for the weak stomached.,7.0,4575
damianphelps, 'Dead End'...That's Funny...Isn't It?,Loses a rating point for the tired game show element.Add Henry Rollins to any project and its worth watching!So the mystery from the first film has been well and truly removed and its been replaced by hack n slash. Ok. Does remove a fraction of depth but the powered up gore does fit the film well.Pretty fun :),6.0,4576
scorbett315-66-982904, Stupid is as stupid does I guess,Loved the very first wrong turn but this one is just absurd from the characters their choices how theyre written and the endless plot holes...So first off were supposed to believe that a combat veteran is going to have no idea what to do when people start dying but some college football player is going to? She was so incompetent it was maddening. First her salutes were awful second her weapon of choice would prove to be completely useless much like her. Glad they killed her.The skater guy was a completely worthless piece of duechebag as well. Like these were supposed to be candidates for a survival show? The only likeable character in the movie they kill early on disappointingly so.No idea why the technical crew wasnt killed they had to spend ample time in those woods setting up the traps and tree cameras but they just walked right out skippedy do da.Rollins was ok but after finally being all tactical he just throws it all away for no reason at all. I dunno this movie was trash. The cut scenes and camera zooms are out of whack imagine zoolander doing his head twist to the camera every time. All the characters are completely unlikable except for the girlfriend but they take care of that pretty early unfortunately and were left a final girl that was worthless the whole movie and the guerrilla warfare tactician football player.3/10 because the deaths were mostly decent but the rest of the actual movie sucked.,3.0,4577
matt_zxy, Rewatch after a long time,I rewatch the film after wrong turn 2021 was released.Here what i thoughtStoryline of this movie was better then the 1st film simple and easy to follow and doesnt leave us wondering at the end of the film.This is was a dvd film (low budget) so nevermind the sick CGI but the cinematography and jump cuts was pretty amateur including some actors which could be better than that.Overall the 1st film was better than this but its still consider watchable.,6.0,4578

robertemerald, Builds to a crescendo of horrors,I was so irritated by the inane bickering and snide humour of Wrong Turn 2: Dead Ends beginning sequences that I decided to watch something else. The movie was starting to improve and certainly there had been a couple of wicked attacks that were cool and I liked Henry Rollins character. I gave the movie to my brother and when I next saw him he was watching it so I eventually came to see the last half as well. Quite an eye opener. The standard between the initial scenes and the penultimate scenes is much improved. I was actually quite amazed at how much terror the movie was generating by then. The actors seemed to be doing way better in the final stages their dodgy characters having risen to the occasion. As such Im happy to give this movie a 7. Perhaps not as accomplished as The Hills Have Eyes (2006) but certainly on the way there. Roll your eyes at the opening nonsense. Believe me it all slots into gear before too long.,7.0,4580
robfollower, glorious gore,This film has the 4 essentials to score big on my scale GruesomeGoreand Gross. And Henry Rollins .The gore is used at the best times and its just flat out gross!

TheLittleSongbird, The series is not yet dead,Judging from my other reviews you would not think that horror films would be my thing especially very gory ones. Actually aim to have a diverse taste in film so seeing films from all decades and genres with no bias intended. Plus have seen my fair share of horror franchises where at least one film has been good.Found myself surprisingly enjoying Wrong Turn when slowly working my way through the films. The second film and first sequel Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is not quite as good but is easily one of the better sequels and films in the series and perhaps the only one of the sequels to be nearly equal to the first. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is bloodier and gorier than Wrong Turn with the in-jokes one-liners and put-downs the dialogue is wittier and less cheesy than that in Wrong Turn and it is just as fun. The ending also works better here it is contrived somewhat but at least there is much more of a sense of a film-knowing-how-to-end-it ending.At the same time Wrong Turn 2: Dead End does lack the tension-building suspenseful claustrophobia and mystery of the first film and it is let down by some of the first half being dull and dumb with some of the dialogue being too self-conscious. The story is as simplistic and derivative and the characters as thinly sketched as before.Things pick up significantly in the second half where things become more thrilling inventive fun and skin-crawling. Visually it is imaginatively and slickly shot if not quite as atmospheric as the first film due to times of being too clean. The setting is wonderfully mysterious and creepy and the effects and make-up are as appropriately horrifying as one would expect. The music has some genuine eeriness and Joe Lynch directs very competently with little time wasted after a slightly too overlong beginning.Despite the lack of development for the characters the acting is not bad at all. Henry Rollins and Erica Leerhsen are especially well-cast and are just as ballsy as the three leads in the first film.Overall decently solid and shows that the Wrong Turn series is not yet dead. A dead end this is not. 6/10 Bethany Cox,6.0,4582
MoviesReviews101, Verdict: Bloodier Sequel,Story: We follow a celebrity diva on her way to a reality television pilot where she takes yeah you got it a wrong turn and becomes our first victim. We get to meet the rest of the cast now as they get set to record a reality show about survival after the apocalypse. We see how selfish the characters are but the real battle for survival starts when the games begin and the cannibals join in. Larger cast on both sides of the battle helps the film because we get more confliction more blood and a larger body count. Saying that we do have to get through a whole host are highly unlikable character with the only ones worth supporting are Dale Mara and Jake. The story gets to poke a small bit at how ridiculous reality television is now. It could have gone for the found footage angle with all the contestants wearing head camera but it stays well clear which works well for the film. It really comes off as an improvement from the first film storyline wise feeding into the gorier side of the story. (7/10)Actor ReviewErica Leerhsen: Nina part of the game who wants to keep herself to herself but has to learn to join in to be part of the game and survive. She does get captured but after having help to escape she makes sure the family never feed again. Erica gives an OK performance but I feel she gets lost in the leading lady role. (5/10)Henry Rollins: Dale host of the show and ex-army guy after getting captured early on he used his skills to escape and take out the cannibals before getting to rescue the final two. Henry is the star of the show really you just want to see his character face the cannibals. (8/10)Texas Battle: Jake former college football star whose injuries have left him lacking a career he enters the game for a chance to show off his athletic skills. He is the honest character who helps everyone out even through another shoulder injury. Texas gives a solid performance as the good guy trying to get back on his feet. (6/10)Aleksa Palladino: Mara producers assistant who has to take part in the game after one of the contestants doesnt show up. She starts to enjoy the idea of the game before being betrayed and killed off. She gives a solid supporting performance but never gets a chance to show her skills. (5/10)Daniella Alonso: Amber solider with excellent survival skills taking part in the game. Even with her survival skills she struggles against the cannibals. Average performance as her character should be better. (4/10)Support Cast: Mostly other members of the game the crew and the cannibal family they all add to the story in their own small ways. The cannibals becoming a larger villain than we had first time around.Director Review: Joe Lynch – Increases the level of the film with a bloodier side to the story large body count and a final shot that really is disturbing. (8/10)Horror: More gore blood and kills raise the horror rating on this one. (9/10) Thriller: It loses suspense points mainly because you dont care about enough characters. (7/10) Settings: Great use of settings to create the isolation for the characters. (9/10) Special Effects: Great special effects used for all the kills throughout the film. (10/10) Suggestion: This is one for all the horror fans out there filled with plenty of blood and gore. (Horror Fans Watch) Best Part: Dynamite kill Worst Part: Annoying characters Kill Of The Film: Its in your back pocket dynamite kill Believability: No (0/10) Chances of Tears: No (0/10) Chances of Sequel: Has four more sequels in the franchise Post Credits Scene: NoOscar Chances: No Budget: $4 Million Runtime: 1 Hour 36 Minutes Tagline: Dinner Is ServedOverall: Improvement on a Solid First OutingCheck out more reviews on http://moviesreview101.com/,7.0,4583
arlum_meow, not better than the 1st but a very good sequel,wrong turn 2 dead end isnt better than the first movie but is a very good sequel. although being direct to DVD the movie was a lot better than most of slasher horror movies thats been out in cinemas for the past 10 years no lie. another thing i like about wrong turn 2 better than wrong turn 1 is that they had much more likable characters than the 1st.the plot is a decent plot but could have been thought of better but still fun to watch. the plot is a group of people are competing to win a reality show including Nina Jake Amber Jonesy and last but 100% not least Elena. where they are in the woods home to the hillbillies. so it the deaths start happening 1 by 1.but the same problem that was wrong with the 1st is that you knew the surviours from the beginning and you knew who was going to die next.i liked this movie because it has a lot of laughs and disgusting deaths more graphic than the 1st.just because its a straight to DVD does not mean the movie ist good i thought it was a really good sequel. 6/10,6.0,4584
lewiskendell," Not bad, not bad at all.","""Birth defects. No sh*t.""The ""crazed inbred cannibal hillbillies killing dumb dudes and hot chicks"" genre isnt one of my favorites but Im up for the occasional decent movie. Wrong Turn 2 doesnt do much to turn the genre on its head but at least its entertaining and offers a few characters that manage to be more than the tired horror movie staples that weve seen countless times. The scenario that brings our victims to the backwoods where the cannibals make their home is a reality show hosted by a tough-as-nails ex-marine. Theres the expected annoying sleazy and slutty characters but we also get a few who are likable and sympathetic. So you get the pleasure of cheering the deaths of the crappy characters while hoping that the others can somehow get out of all this alive. The actors are all probably people youve never heard of before but they do their jobs pretty well.  The cannibals themselves look suitably dirty and inbred which is about all I expected. There are a few gruesome deaths but really nothing more over-the-top or violent than what Ive seen in other movies. I could have done without the unnecessary jab at religion that was shoehorned in towards the end but all in all Id say that Wrong Turn 2 was okay. If youre really into these kinds of flicks youll probably like it even more than I did. And if youre anything like me the most disturbing scene in this entire movie will be the one where two of those subhuman monsters start making out. Now THAT is horror.",6.0,4585
Samiam3," Could've been worse, but it's still no good",I suppose it must count for something that unlike so many horror sequels Wrong Turn 2 avoids regurgitating the same material as the first. Too bad this is the only thing the movie does right. The more we progress through the story of Wrong Turn 2 the more difficult it becomes to believe that it is intended to be treated as pure horror. There are signs that it wants to be part comedy. Either way the movie doesnt work. It gets increasingly dull derivative and it has an overlong finale that Tobe Hooper could probably file a plagiarism suit against.Even though it is perhaps a bit chirpy the film has an interesting set up. Six kids are about to embark on a Survivor-type game in the woods while being documented in reality-TV style. before long however they find themselves fighting not merely to win but to live as they come face to face with something that definitely was not part of the programme.The ravenous mountain men from the first wrong turn have lost their monstrosity. There is nothing remotely frightening about these men. Instead they are goofy and get too much screen time. I suppose in the End the film couldve been worse. Its not like I walked out on it but in the end it is just too devoid of merit to be worth watching.,5.0,4586
KineticSeoul," More bloody, less serious","This one is more of a gore fest compared to the first one and revolves around characters that are in some low budget survival game show like the show ""Survivor"" except the cast are fighting for survival literally after they encounter some inbred hillbilly mutant psychos. I was thoroughly impressed with this sequel its just a lot more entertaining and gruesome than the first however one of the cast members had a ""Battle Royale"" shirt on which is somewhat of a disgrace seeing how much of a awesome movie that was compared to this one. Anyways while the first movie was going in a more serious direction the characters in this one is comedic and not as serious as the first. From the jerkoff or a more annoying and less funny version of Stifler to the douche bag boyfriend to the nice girl to the tough chick to the tough guy to the slut and etc. The characteristics of some of these characters are however sort of creative with the lesbo to the sensitive jock to the bipolar vegan to the action hero and etc. And through the course of events your views on them change which was a nice touch and it even had a decent character development which usually dont happen for this type of genre. Another aspect of this film I really liked was how you cant guess who is going to die and who is going to survive and for films like these you can predict pretty easily but that wasnt the case for this one. From the beginning scene of the film I could tell I was in for a bloody good time and wasnt going to be going in a serious direction which really worked. There is one event of this film that seems to happen in a lot of survival horror movies that I really dislike where the hero or heroine goes back to save someone and end up getting screwed and wished they did more with the reality game show they were on and mock it some more. I also disliked how they gave the inbred hillbillies more human characteristics compared to the first WT it sort of makes them less creepy. But despite that this was a entertaining slasher film with a lot of gore and mayhem. If this had a bigger budget it just might have made it into theaters instead of going straight to DVD and Blu-ray.7/10",7.0,4587
ctomvelu1, Axe me no questions,A group of reality show contestants participating in a SURVIVOR-type game in the backwoods of West Virgin-nie runs afoul of the killer hillbilly family we came to know and love in the first movie. One by one the contestants are picked off and eaten until were down to a bloody few. Will anyone survive? Henry Rollins is the only name actor in the cast and he does a Rambo-like bit when he turns the tables on the killers midway through. Some decent deaths and stunts although the movie lacks the visceral impact and shock of the original. Also we see way too much of the hillbillies so that they become parodies of themselves. In the first movie we didnt gets as good a look at them until late in the game and they spoke in a distinctive and sometimes frightening guttural lingo. Here they are constantly on screen and talk like Hollywoods idea of cave people. Nevertheless WT2 is worth a look. For horror film fans there are tributes to THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE HILLS HAVE EYES and even Friday THE 13TH (the last is a great bar bet trivia question for those in the know). A second WT sequel released in 2009 has a busload of escaped prisoners running afoul of the remaining inbreds. Hmnn ... I wonder how tourism is doing in West Virginia these days? The joke is of course that this was actually shot in Canada.,6.0,4588
SHARP-21, oh dear oh dear oh dear,whats the point will someone tell me for the love of jebus why they keep making crap like this. god is it too much to ask for just a simple well thought well scripted and well directed slasher film but noooooo we get this steaming pile of poo. come on the very beginning of the film where the girl gets cut in half i decided to wake up my 5 year old son and let him watch it because he likes comedys to. the original is so much better in every way and its not to stupid yeh it still has the same lost teens but its is executed in such a better way. bottom line is. acting - 300 script - -100000000 cast - typical dysfunctional teens -1000000000 (change the record) direction - the director should have been killed -100000000000000000000 the production company who made it - hopefully it went bust,1.0,4589
Sam_Movie_Buff," You know what they say, second times the slump!","Back in 2003 I picked up the first Wrong Turn - initially because the gorgeous Eliza Dushku but now look at it as one of the best horror movies of its genre. The first movie was great from start to finish. Everything from the look plot acting script etc.. was 110%. The movie relied on pure suspense instead of pouring endless amounts of blood in your face - Wrong Turn 2: Dead End has pretty much the opposite on all of the above.This movie could have been a great sequel but instead it comes off cheap second rate and merely lack luster to its first. This is probably due to the fact that no person(s) from the first movie were involved with the project - and I can understand why.The movie starts off well with a great opening - possibly better than the first opening but after 15 minutes passed I quickly realised It wasnt going to be anything on the original. The story of a reality show in the woods scary house etc.. has been done to death (House on Haunted Hill Halloween Resurrection) so the plot seemed dull from the start. The film has no suspense and just lays it all out on the table and by that I mean anything thats anything (body part wise). There is so much gore that it gets slightly ridiculous. The first movie was well crafted and just gave enough gore to scare you the sequel however just flows a blood bath which came off really tacky and desperate. The acting was okay. There were a couple of actors I was surprised to see on here. Especially Erica Leerhsen. She starred in the 2003 remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the movie did extremely well. I mean It was a remake and most Hollywood remakes get thrashed by critics but the film actually received great reviews. So she was obviously type casted for this role. Why she wanted to be involved in this project - I dont know. Maybe she thought she was gonna be the next ""Scream Queen"" after this I doubt it. Possibly a second rate B-horror actor. I can see that happening for sure.There were many scenes in the movie that just shouldnt have been included. One being the inbred brother and sister having sex in the woods. There was no need to include this in the movie. When we hear a family is inbred-incest we know what that means. We certainly dont have to see it happening full swing. The scene is horrific and disgusting. Another downfall is the special effects make-up on the monsters. It was a big disappointment and they resembled nothing like the original mountain men. In the first film you only caught glimpses of the mad men that made it even more scarier. The ""freaks"" in Dead End however are very in your face and the more screen close ups you get the more the make-up looks obviously fake and badly done. Very B movie like.Are we surprised this movie didnt see theatrical release? NO.All in all the movie was below average. When are film makers going to learn having so much gore does not do any justice to the movie itself. Especially when half the gore doesnt even look semi-real.If you are a fan of the first movie dont expect the same results with Wrong Turn 2: Dead End. But if you absolutely must see this movie then at least you were warned.",1.0,4590
jaseness, What went wrong,This is one of the worst horror movies ever crap acting crap special effects crap story. Thay could have made this better then the first if they used the KNF special effects group and had a better director. Like Hills 2 iam worried about sequels must of them are wrong.Hostel 2 just passed my standards we need more fear and scare in our horror movies these days not just shock from gore (even know that gore is good) it still needs the scare to go with it.Fine eg is the Exorist and the first hills remake there had all the right stuff to scare and shock.I hope things get back on track because whats the use in spending money on a movie like WT2 when it was crap.Iam sorry if people think that this is a good movie i think you need to rethink your view on this.,2.0,4591
The_Void, Blood and guts galore in a surprisingly good sequel,"The original Wrong Turn seemed like it would be just another Texas Chainsaw Massacre style horror movie...and indeed thats all it was; but it was actually surprisingly decent for what it was and I was pleasantly surprised. Like most people I thought the idea of a sequel was unwarranted and wasnt particularly interested; but as the largely positive reviews started to roll in I figured I may as well give the film a chance. Well...I can say that my thoughts on the film arent as glowing as some of the reviews that Ive read but overall this is an entertaining and well done sequel and I dont regret watching it. The plot seems rather unimaginative but works quite well. We focus on a new survival-style reality TV show called ""The Ultimate Survivalist: The Apocalypse"" and it just so happens that this game show is being filmed in the woods where the events of the first film took place. After being introduced to the characters (a mostly clichéd lot) they are let loose into the woods and naturally its not long before they come face to face with the deformed family that the group in the original fell foul of.The film is a sequel in name only really; it does obviously feature the same location and (similar) antagonists but so do a lot of other films and I guess the name is in place to cash in on the original...not that it really matters. The way the film plays out is completely by the numbers but director Joe Lynch focuses on the important elements and the film manages to stay entertaining for the duration. We kick off with a sequence that shows some ridiculously over the top gore and that really just sets up the rest of the film. The gore scenes are blood soaked and fairly inventive and see things like people getting axed in the face hacked to death and split right down the middle. The main difference between this follow up and the original is that we get some more info on the deformed family; both in terms of an explanation (which takes heavy influence from The Hills Have Eyes) and some insight into how they live (culminating in a scene that takes obvious influence from TCM). Its not big and its not clever but if youre looking for ninety minutes of entertainment; you could do a hell of a lot worse than this.",6.0,4592
pugheaven, God Awful Watch The Original INstead,Wrong Turn 2 - Well it comes as no surprise that this film is quite simply put... the worst film I think I have ever seen. I thought Id seen it all with Death Proof Captivity and Balad Of Ricky Bobby... but this... yes this is the worst film Ive ever seen. Its an insult to the original film (which is an 8/10 for its genre)... and how it ever got funding is anyones guess. From the first 5 minute intro you know youre in trouble.. a ridiculous decapitation/slice and the stupidest music ever to accompany it and you know that youre in for 1.5 hours of drivel... and guess what I wasnt disappointed.Whats wrong with this film is like the world at the moment... they feel the need to do it from the silly perspective of a reality show (anyone remember the reality Halloween?) Why shoukld this be interesting? The characters are all retards who you couldnt care less about... the effect are appalling the story is ludicrous... the acting is some of the worst Ive seen since time began making Jason & The Arganaunts look realistic... I wanted every last one of these teenagers to DIE! And whats worse is Henry Rollins take on Predator... he basically turns into a Schwarzenegger character. I have to say... that Im sure this film isnt meant to be taken seriously as surely someone out there doesnt think hes created a masterpiece... however he has... hes created the benchmark that all other trash films (of which this year 2007 seems to have created the most) should be judged. This is a 0/10 film... however IMDb wont allow this so a 1/10 it has to be. Sick twisted and not even inspried gore that isnt very well done at all. If you at least want clever gore watch Saw III which in itself is appalling but ingenious in its ways to die! Stay Clear.,1.0,4593
Score_The_Film, There's only ONE reason to watch this - Henry Rollins,"I did not see the first one. I typically avoid stupid bone-head movies like it. When I heard decent things about this one and that it also had Henry Rollins in it I figured what the hell.For what this film is I can deal with the set-up as contrived as it is. As far as I could tell there were only two real actors in this thing; Rollins and Wayne Robson (Old Timer). I cant believe Im actually saying this.The dialogue was hideous. Its littered with cliché after cliché. Good thing it was also littered with corpses.And what the hell is up with the ""halloween hillbillies""? Its as if the film makers said ""Hey! What if Chunk from The Goonies had kids and then they knocked around and had more kids?"" It would have been more effective if they looked more realistic and less cartoony.I have to give credit for the director Joe Lynch who pretty much saved this movie. Im impressed as much was accomplished with a budget of only 4 mil.One bright side - only two survivors. Most of the characters and all of the contestants were annoying. I was really hoping they would all die. What a nice bonus that would have been. Oh well. Thems tha breaks I guess.",4.0,4594
scobbah, Henry Rollins saves WT2 from 1/10 vote,Utterly poor how is that for a review? Some people gather in the woods to shoot an adventurous reality show but they soon find themselves being hunted by a group of hideous cannibals. Noteworthy is that the characterisation is boring because all the characters are stereotypes to such an extent that one has problems deciding whether or not this film is a parody of genre or just extremely cliché and trying to get away with it.I can conceive of the target audience of the film being either teenagers or young adults; the film only features stereotyped characters; the soundtrack is pretty limited to teenage pop-rock music; some of the experiences of the characters prior to the gory part of the film are simply those teenagers or young adults are likely to experience.I guess Henry Rollins is the true hero of this film and the only reason why I am not giving this film a 1/10 vote. Amidst poor effects and even poorer acting Henry Rollins contributes in a great way to this film with his Ramboish cliché character.Even if you are looking for a film which requires no thought whatsoever I would not recommend this film.3/10,3.0,4595
raypdaley182," Oh no, Not Again","In reviewing the original Wrong Turn I didnt say much hated the movie and hoped they didnt make a sequel.Guess what they went and did? Made a sequel. Gee thanks - NOT! Like the last film your thrown right into the action a pretty blond actress on her way to a reality TV project knocks over one of the mountain people breaks at least one of his legs and gives him serious concussion.But he comes around in less than 2 minutes to bite her face off.When we see the second mountain person I lost interest right there Only 1 mountain person survived the 1st film so thats goof #1 right there!The reality TV cast members are introduced to us as well as a few members of the crew.Very early one 1 girl is established as a vegan (to no doubt be set-up to eat meat or be disgusted by something involving meat later predicting that now!).Henry Rollins line about ""Post Apocolyptic Crazies are waiting all around to take you down"" well he wasnt to know how right he was? It was pretty predictable that the token Asian Guy died 1st. Henry Rollins as a former Marine Colonel gets captured by the mountain people WAY too easily. The camera guy is caught by his girlfriend getting a blow job so you know he is going to die! It also gets the producer girl killed by an Axe in the head as she escaped from the house. Cutting to the cameraman boyfriend (totally unaware his lady is dead) with the girl who had been giving him a blow job pulling on her panties is there to tell us they have had sex while his girlfriend was being killed. As any good horror fan knows that means both of them will die having had sex.We also get a shot of one of the mountain people who had obviously been watching them and were supposed to assume hes masturbating as he watches the girl. She is killed by the girl of the mountain people (slashed to death in a stream) and now were getting to see the mountain peoples faces a lot so their no longer sticking with the old horror convention of ""the less you see the monster the more scary it is"".Rollins manages to get free has a brief fight and kills one of the mountain men (there appear to be 5 of them so that leaves 4?) with a shotgun. The scene between him and the old man (it is obvious he IS the father of mountain people) is played out to quieten down the pace of the film. The father gets a good death scene (blown apart by a stick of dynamite) leaving us with 4 of the freaks left.As the surviving group of contestants escapes they hear the sounds of sex (again?) and its the brother & sister of the mountain people family practicing incest. The survivor group then break the next horror film rule by splitting up (never split up safety in numbers!).The black jock saves Nina from a mantrap only to re-injure his shoulder (hes only been talking about it for the whole film to this point!). Jones & Amber are captured by 2 stupidly simple traps. Jones is killed by the son of the mountain people (arrow through the eye) and it appears he also killed Amber with same arrow. Funny that my money was on Amber to live as a female Marine.The cameraman boyfriend (M) is killed next by the sister of the mountain people (some sort of cleaver chopping his head off) and the blond girl is captured outside the camera truck as the black jock watches M die on camera.As predicted the vegan girl is fed cooked human flesh (the ultimate insult to her as a vegan of course but was so easily predicted by me). Then having shown us an industrial grade shredder you know someone will later be thrown into or fall into that it was an obvious set-up for a future scene. Rollins cuts himself to lay a fake trail of blood to follow (to obviously lead the brother and sister into a trap).He shoots the brother in the back with an arrow but it has dynamite on blowing him up (it is unknown at this point if the sister was blown up too but I assumed she was). Now Nina looks like she was secured by her arms to the chair by razor-wire. Rollins uses his knife to free her but she gets cut pretty badly.Rollins is finally killed by a combination of 2 arrows to the torso and a chain bolas around the throat (but he had been stabbed previously 3 times as well) after freeing Nina and the black jock.The father tries to feed the black jock into the shredder (what did I tell you this film is nothing if not predictable?) but Nina comes back knocks over the mother to save the Jock the mother half pulls the father out but Nina slams them both into the shredder with by releasing a previously unseen log (Ah! its a shredder to make logs into paper because its a Paper Mill!).The final scene is a little naughty as clearly the film makers lost count how many of the mountain family had died (all of them except the baby even though the daughter was never actually seen to die) with an unseen and assumed male mountain person feeding the families baby on the chemicals that caused them to deform.Weak Film Weak and VERY Predictable plot and extremely weak ending.Its a bad film when the film makers cant keep track of how many of their own characters theyve killed.",1.0,4596
JoeB131," Definitely a wrong turn, too.",Okay not a terribly original idea a family of inbred mutants engage in cannibalism by picking off incredibly dumb reality TV show contestants.Gee where have we seen this premise before? Hills have Eyes and Texas Chain Saw massacre to start with.This movie follows the Joe Bob Briggs rule of Drive-In movies that anyone can die at any time. Using the Joe Bob system we have 14 dead bodies and two naked breasts. Mutant Sex.A lot of the gore involves things that are probably physically impossible but look cool and gory so that is why the producers included them.Not really worth your time.,1.0,4597
ianmutimer, poo-poo in the loo-loo,Lordy this was lame. The first one had a far superior storyline and actually had me interested even wanting the folks NOT to die. This feeling was retracted somewhat in no.2 because the characters either were such bad actors or they ANNOYED THE POPCORN OUTTA ME! Its a reality game show (woopee do Im sure this sounds familiar) where they have to survive in the forest for 5 days. It REALLY annoys me when they start the killing too early in movies why cant they build a storyline and tension then deliver the gore? After the first death a blond chick who got sliced her body looked so fake/rubber when they dragged her away it was practically bouncing down the road. The most annoying character was the x-games guy he was the one i wanted the most to die. (unfortunately i had to wait over an hour for this to happen) He was simply over the top dumb with stupid sexual innuendo jokes that were in no way funny for example he would see a spear and say to a girl ooo look its so hard and long hahahahaha SHUT IT! what a goober. When the game show host was introducing the game he said the number 2 immediately the goober guy said ooo i just did one of those at the gas station COME ON! Of course dumb dialogue was not isolated when they were looking for their friends after they were missing one guy ingeniously exclaimed lets take the woods if we take the road well be sitting ducks Advantages of taking the road: you can see whats going on have a chance of seeing a car to help. Advantages of taking the woods: you have a great chance of getting lost and an even better chance of being sliced and diced by the yocal inbreds that live there. hmmm tough choice?! This movie is just a copy with dumb youngsters doing dumb things and getting rightfully slaughtered for their mistakes! like when they see 2 inbreds getting jiggy with it (totally unnecessary scene) one kid shouts hey! WHY?! and then one girl randomly runs off and falls in a hole. The rest fight and nearly die. There is one line that the blond and the athlete keep saying that i so 1980s - sue me. They seem to think its really funny and keep saying it my thoughts - SHUT UP. I will leave on a positive note there is one funny line for the game show host/commando guy after blowing up an old man with dynamite (whose wife died sometime in he past) he delivers this beauty - say hello to the missus not great but enough to make me smile. DONT SEE IT!,5.0,4598
dannylennon1981, How Rubbish Is This Movie,The reason why i gave this movie a 4 is because of all the gory  i must say this is one of the most worse horror movies i have ever seen  not once did i jump or feel like something would make me jump  the acting was awful even for a horror movie  the first Wrong Turn movie was full of shocks and jumps and the acting was not that bad i really enjoyed it  but this mess of a sequel is not even worthy of a straight to DVD release  the mutants in this movie look unrealistic and daft  this movie should never have been mad but will still make 50 million at the box office due to spotty teenagers with a taste for gore  if you have nothing better to do for 1 hour 20 mins do not watch this movie as its 1 hour 20 of your life wasted when you could done something more interesting like wash your hair,4.0,4599
user-18091, Poor audience,Ive been hearing and reading so much about this film and have really been looking forward to seeing it. What a waste of time that was. Im appalled by how lousy this film is. I love the first one which also inspired me to write a film-script. This is a travesty!!! I read a review that the actors were good. Okay! Can we say acting-school? Their the lowest of low. How any of them even gets jobs is out of this world. Henry Rollins aint that bad though. I like the story. Actually been thinking the same idea myself. This is not what i would have made. I think horror should be done with grace not gulp! The only halfly amusing was the opening scene were a girl gets chopped in half. When i saw that i thought this would be great. I almost fell asleep during the rest. Who wants to get to know these creatures? in the first one they were creepy as s**t but now they just annoy me. Please dont make any more of these films. They should have made the first and then stopped.,3.0,4600
ofumalow," Not dull, but pretty braindead","The first ""Wrong Turn"" was hardly original but it had vigor suspense and a few good twists of fate. This is your typical franchise cashout in that they decide to immediately go for a broad bad-taste comedy tone with annoying characters representing various stereotypes and an already-exhausted point of ""satire"" (the victims are reality-show contestants this time) as the story gimmick.The good news is that the film is decently paced and is pretty zesty as far as violence/gore goes. The bad news is...well pretty much everything else. Ive found Henry Rollins variable as an actor yet hes the best thing here-the only performer who (in basically playing a semi-parodic Rambo) manages to acknowledge the ridiculousness of the material while nonetheless making it work. The others are just one kind of caricature or another whether its shallow then panicked victims or grotesque ""cannibal mutant hillbillies"" who have to be shown french kissing and such.The film has sufficient energy and is ""stupid"" in a semi-deliberate jokey way. But its still...well stupid neither scary enough to qualify as real horror or clever/funny enough to rate as good horror-comedy. The climax (though it starts out less as an homage to the original ""Texas Chainsaw"" than blatant imitation) at least ratchets things up a notch through sheer splattery excess; hence the 5 rating rather than a 4. Still its weird to me that so many people seem to think this is better than the original. Then again you can never underestimate how many fanboy types think dumb yoks and over-the-top gore are all you need for perfect entertainment.",5.0,4601
saptesh786, Reality Shows turn into horror show.,Perhaps this is the best part in all parts of Wrong Turn. A reality show in woods turn into wrong turn of horror. Some actresses are gorgeous.

LoneWolfAndCub," An awful sequel to an average movie, but not without its charms",Wrong Turn was an average but entertaining enough backwoods slasher in the vein of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is exactly the same except it has more gore and absolutely no atmosphere. This straight-to-DVD sequel is nothing special and is more of an action/horror movie than a straight out horror movie. First off it has a fairly fast pace meaning that characters have a standard introductory scene and if they are lucky enough a two minute scene revealing their past and why we should feel sorry for them. Secondly the acting is bad well Erica Leerhsen is quite good she does a decent job as the heroine but no one else is interesting in the slightest. Furthermore the story is nothing to write home about and in a film like this it really doesnt need to be Oscar material. Also the dialogue is atrocious with way too many bad one-liners and lame attempts at humour. However not all is bad for all the gorehounds out there this film ramps up the level from the first film and has some surprisingly brutal death scenes (especially the opening which I thought was well played out). Moreover the film never gets boring director Joe Lynch is smart enough to know we want outrageous death scenes and lots of brainless action and he does deliver on that part. The villains are stereotypical inbred hillbillies with all the deformities and family bonding we have all seen done better before.Wrong Turn 2 never promised to be anything big or genre-defining and although it is an appalling film it is also entertaining and for people looking for a cheap thrill you cant do much better than this nowadays.2/5,4.0,4605
lastliberal," Okay, from now on, you'll be the uptight lesbian sister I never had. Deal?","Whoa! Kimberly (Kimberly Caldwell) definitely didnt get an American Idol ticket to Hollywood as she makes a wrong turn on the way to a reality show and we get a gore treat that will blow your mind. This is in the first 10 minutes! Now I am telling you that this is they way those reality shows should be done. Put the contestants in the woods with incredibly ugly mutant cannibals and see who makes it out. Id be a regular viewer.People are dropping like flies and soon there are just a few left: Nina (Erica Leerhsen) Amber (Daniella Alonso) Jake (Texas Battle - ""The Bold and the Beautiful"") Jonsey (Steve Braun) and Dale (Henry Rollins). Blood is flowing from arrows and axes knives. It really gets gross at times so this is not for the faint of heart.Dale gets all Rambo with war paint and weapons. There are only two left for him to save.The ending was raw! I cannot imagine what they will come up with in Wrong Turn 3.",7.0,4606
eddax, The fact that some of these people don't deserve to be eaten is enough to put this movie at a notch above the rest,I apparently liked the first Wrong Turn but I dont remember why not. Maybe it was because Eliza Dushku got to kick ass. *Buffy withdrawal*This sequel is more of the same: bunch of people in the woods meet mutated cannibals. The difference here is that the meat are contestants of a reality show and are hence drastically different personalities. Some of them are even refreshingly not annoying and/or stupid! One of them - a retired Marine - is even resourceful! Wow! So anyway *chase chase kill eat*. Not tremendously original but the fact that some of these people dont deserve to be eaten is enough to put this movie at a notch above the rest. 7,7.0,4607
vampyrecowboy, Wow...what a tasty meal,To get the best taste while eating raw flesh season it with a touch of lemon pepper seasoning salt and a hint of mustard.Now...if you want to take it a step further lightly braise in the oven for approximately 25 minutes on 450 Fahrenheit take out turn over rub some barbecue sauce over it then put back in the oven for another 15 minutes on 350 Fahrenheit.Be sure to add some onions a few slices of pepper - hot pepper works just as good and gives it an extra zing.Chop some carrots a clove of garlic and maybe a radish just for some zeal.Serve with red wine and as a desert...I suggest a light chocolate mouse with brain toppings.This meal makes a delicious Sunday dinner or is absolutely a feast delight for any holiday festivities.Enjoy...Awesome gruesome movie....,7.0,4608
abbo450, It really isn't bad.,If you are looking for a intelligent well acted and original gore film do not watch this. However if you are looking for a fun night in that occasionally makes you laugh and wince at the same time Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is certainly for you.I have seen so many gore/slasher films and most of them are as predictable as England losing a penalty shootout. You can always tell by guessing who is going to survive before the killing begins. Usually Im spot on but this time my top two three nominations died. This is refreshing and makes you want to see the end to see if there any more surprises.Again the actual deaths usually are slightly un-original e.g. head decapitated. But not this film the first death makes you recoil so much that you end up molded to the chair your sitting in and there is one more death that I dont think has ever been done before.There is a slight bit of storytelling and back story for the main characters but mostly it is just kill and kill and kill. Overall it was a very surprising and enjoyable film (apart from the end) and it baffles me that this was a direct to DVD while Hills have Eyes got a theatrical release.,7.0,4609
mothergeorge," Not much depth, but gore. Lots, and lots of gore.",You heard right. Anybody who looks for new gore that can actually be compared to 80s/90s films like Day of the Dead and Hellraiser 2 (or even Braindead) your film is this.This is one of the most violent films Ive seen for a long time. Interesting ideas too - Not to ignore the opening scene of an actress being sliced clean in half from the head down and having both halves dragged across the floor by two inbreds - while having that it also keeps an element of classic twisted gore visuals (such as a carcass suspended from the feet intestines dangling into a bucket etc).A great film needs more than impressive gore though. Like I said if thats your thing and youre looking for the nastiest films this ranks somewhere near the top.It is entertaining enough but the characters have barely any depth. You basically have to interpret the characters by what you first see of them and its all very stereotypical. In ways of plot a lot of the things were very mundane and predictable. It sort of needs to be for this kind of film but there wasnt much chemistry between the characters - the standout for that was the demise of Jonesy (Steve Braun) and Amber (Daniella Alonso) at how they developed some kind of acceptance for each other before they died.There wasnt much of a breather for this film - when everything starting to kick in during the beginning it never paused. They should have taken a break amidst the terror and built some foundation between the people about to be slaughtered.I say that though doesnt mean the acting was flat...Top notch performance from everyone they all stayed committed and determined to stay within their persona during the film they just werent performing for their full potential.Some parts were just plain nasty and Im not talking about the violence. Inbred sex is the main thing Im talking about. INCEST inbred sex. I knew at some point they would have had a visual like that but I was still unprepared. Its sick...and again if thats what youre looking for...To sum it up (for those who cant be bothered to read all of this) Wrong Turn 2 is definitely a film for visuals. It should definitely be recognised and respected amongst the goriest films ever made. Ive seen violent films that had more character development and emotional interaction though (the Saw films come to mind) and this film could have done a little more to build on the cast and the plot.Plot/Characters - 3/10 Violence/Visuals - 10/10 Acting - 9/10 Quality/Effects - 9/10 Sound - 7/10OVERALL: 7/10,7.0,4610
Andy20789, A Good Film,"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End was quite a good film but for me it went quite over-the-top with all of the violence blood and gore. It seemed to me like they were just putting in all of this senseless and bloody violence just for the sake of it. It seemed like a feeble attempt to gain an ""18"" certificate. But dont get me wrong it was a good film. Some moderately scary moments but most of the time it was just thrilling edge-of-the-seat stuff.Of course when you watch a film about cannibals of course youre going to get blood and gore and violence but for me it was just a little too much in this film. I wouldnt recommend this film to anybody under the age of 16.I enjoyed watching it and I found some of the deaths amusing but in the end I just grew tired of all the violence. I guess you could say that I have mixed views on this film. Still the final scene of the movie leaves the plot open for a ""Wrong Turn 3"".",5.0,4611
horrorforpresident," Well it was Okay, Not as good as the first","When the original Wrong Turn came out I was sort of curious and uninterested at the same time. I saw it and I liked it but it didnt really stay with me. Yet it was good. When i heard that they were going to make a second my reaction was the same yet I was less interested. But it turned out to be okay.The basic Wrong Turn concept is typical horror. Teens in the woods with weird things running around trying to kill them. Except instead of creatures the weird things are in fact deformed cannibal hicks who want to eat them. They are weird looking but not scary or disgusting.The story of this odd sequel is there are a group of young actors/""real people"" who are starring in a fake reality show that turns in to a fight for their lives in minutes with mutant cantabiles who want them for dinner. The 93 minute blood bath is typical new horror with a bit of a twist and some cool moments. However the film fails to deliver as the first did and lacks any real point to the story. Rent it if you love blood and guts but if you have second thoughts go with them.Overall Wrong Turn 2 Dead End is nothing amazing and isnt anything that will leave you stunned. But if you like insane mutant on human action and gore you should enjoy this one.",5.0,4612
sabenge, Sue me,A group of twenty-somethings as part of a Survivor clone reality show are stuck in the woods amidst a barrage of mutant inbred hillbillies and must fight for their lives. Youve seen this before right? Of course. What you havent seen before though is this premise done well.Neoteric director Joe Lynch takes us on a journey of sordid proportions as we see what life is really like when you ingest toxic waste and dont become a superhero. The mutants have much more screen time and human appeal than the original. They watch television eat and pray together. All the things that normal families do. The father even lets his son use his bow to murder their soon to be family dinner. If thats not love I dont know what is.The cast is well rounded with Henry Rollins and Erica Leerhsen being the primary focus. Rollins is as usual inimitably portraying the hardcore tough-as-nails ex-marine that we love him for. Throughout the bulk of the movie as the other characters are making a mad dash around frantically and yelling at each other he is tactically hiding in the woods planning and preparing himself and looks a lot like a low-budget Rambo in the process. Leerhsen on the other hand is running through every nook and cranny of the forest to avoid the mutants yet always runs into them. I have to hand it to her though her performance was the best Ive seen in awhile in any movie.If youve ever watched an H.G. Lewis movie and enjoyed it youll love this.,7.0,4613
MairegChernet, yet another run-of-the-mill sequel.,i just saw wrong turn 2:dead end on DVD. it was one of those sequels that you expect a lot out of( considering the fact that wrong turn was a great thriller) yet i did not get the thrill the first wrong turn put me through.the movie focuses upon a group of reality show contestants finding themselves stranded in a forest inhabited by deformed cannibals. i must say this sequel had a lot more violence and gore than the first one. although director Joe Lynch decided to put a tremendous amount of blood and violence in the movie in my opinion the casting was weak and the acting was prosaicnothing special. but i gotta say young actress Erica Leerhesen( she played Nina in the movie) did impress me the most. especially after seeing her in Texas chainsaw massacre and the other roles she has played i believe she is an incredible actress.one thing that disappointed me the most was the lack of suspenseful moments i mean when i saw the first wrong turn i had to get off my seat every 10 or 15 minutes. i was expecting the same thing on the sequel. but what i got did not impress me that much.if you are somebody who hasnt seen this movie and wants to see it my advice is go ahead give it a try. it is not a bad movie. it is just that it did not put me in a thrill ride as i was hoping it would.compared to some desperate movies in the genre of horror such as the remake of Halloween(Im talking about the one rob zombie just made in 2007 the one that made me regret that i went to the movies to see such an awful movie) wrong turn 2 is an OK movie. but it is definitely not better than the first wrong turn. my overall perspective of the movie is that it was not the worst sequel yet could have been a lot better.,6.0,4614
Abztraakt, Its good enough to rent,"Wrong Turn 2 is pretty much everything youd expect from a straight to DVD sequel to a horror film. A somewhat ridiculous storyline with some corny lines for the most part average acting some below average and of course gore. Youll find that out pretty quick. Theres not a lot of scare factor to this film as the ""monsters"" even with the horrid deformities seem almost comic like but still it definitely brings the gore. Even more gore than the first film and probably more than a lot of other big screen slashers but lets be honest with this type of movie without lots of gore it would just fail miserably so kudos to the director and his team on that. I also think it was a nice edition to make some of the ""monsters"" female. Henry Rollins also brought a nice sort of action element to the mix. Overall if you like gory slasher films this is a good rental.",6.0,4615
Cemetarygirl, Country living will never be the same,What is missing from this movie? Suspense? This is just another gore fest with a very very close knit bunch of deformed cannibals. Who again have managed to start a car collection that anyone would be proud to own. They could have a field day on ebay. I mean in one of those cars a laptop must exist. Therefore they could have had more money bought a few things had them delivered maybe ordered a Christmas hamper and ate the delivery dude. Now let me think. Hum! they could not have been too far into the backwoods as there where plenty of cars and these idiots on the survivor show where there. So why no man-hunts for all these missing people? And why is it assumed that these monsters would act this way? And although it would be difficult due to deformities for some of these people to speak (apart from a clear Amen) You would think the parents of the original kids would teach them simple language skills. But I digress (And yes expect far too much from my film-makers)Again predictable deaths (up to a point) and much too quick for these tormenting cannibals who actually enjoy playing with their food. Biggest loss Henry Rollins He should have survived and got away. What idiot scriptwriter/director though killing him was a good idea. He was so funny in parts and I laughed out loud at his quips and Rambo-esquire fight preparations. Bad bad film-makers for killing him off. And when the survivors go to the local cops (if they do) then they should all be fired for doing such a bad job of policing this area. And the green stuff in the water bad CGI didnt look real for one second. I would have liked to see the survivors standing over the crib looking at the baby and wondering what to do with it.

georgedunc, This was really bad!,Possibly The worst movie I have ever seen. I registered to comment on this as it was so truly bad! Do not pay to watch this movie! I found that the plot was zero the acting was zero! Am I making my self clear? It was simply a movie full off gore which had no plot to it whatsoever? Right from the start it was clear that it was going to be bad! If you love this movie then you love the wrong things! It was not realistic and it had no depth to it.This is a C class movie that i really wish i had never watched!and for the rest of the ten lines then all i have isIt was so bad!,1.0,4617
noxaeternus, The worst film I have ever seen. I am sorry to say. Possible spoilers.,I obviously did not watch the same film as some of the people reviewing here. Dont get me wrong I am a huge fan of horror and gore but this was downright stupid. Bad acting. terrible and repeating special effects. What is the obsession with intestines ? Very very difficult to believe any of it. I really tried hard. On the first one there was an element of surprise I did not know what to expect here we just got shots of flesh and not much else oh sorry and a few scenes with John Rambo. If you like the Zombie and Gore genre especially good examples such as both the original and the remake of Dawn of the Dead Hills have Eyes the Evil Dead series do yourself a favour dont watch this and be put off this genre for life !!! I hated it. Worst ever.,1.0,4618
Scarecrow-88, Wrong Turn 2:Dead End,"A reality survivalist game in the woods of Greenbrier Back Country West Virginia brings in a group of clichés to be hunted down and slaughtered in this sick gratuitously gory sequel releasing the inbred cannibal family to brutally slay with glee.Henry Rollins is the host as a Marine who goes Rambo when hes almost included on the menu escaping by the skin of his teeth. He gets a chance to blow a man to smithereens with a stick of dynamite blow one cannibal away with a powerful shot-gun blast that sends that joker sky-rocketing and even hits one inbred with an arrow shot with taped dynamite that ignites the bastard and his girlfriend/sister. Oh but the family get in on the fun too. When two contestants get caught on one of those rope traps that suspends you upside down in the air they receive an arrow through the eyeball. Another contestant is sliced repeatedly in the back by a butcher knife that exposes her spine. One gets his head removed in bloody fashion and we later see it worked on by the family in preparation for supper. In a surprising change of pace the film seems to build one female character as a slasher heroine(she has all the goody-two-shoes traits that make her a sympathetic cliché)only to see her get the axe..literally. And we must not forget the very opening kill which sets up the brutal nature of the rest of this splatter-fest as a female contestant gets her lower lip and chin-skin eaten away by one of the inbreds and then split right down the middle by another inbred with an axe.The character cliché list includes a skateboarder jokester a very bitchy vegan a female producer whose so in love with her executive producing boyfriend shell join the team when the other contestant ""opted out""(the one who isnt present introduced a tattoo that offers a nice little gruesome joke for twisted effect) a black football star whose career was cut short due to injury and a lesbian military officer..all these contestants are sent into the woods to unbeknownest to them square off not in competition with each other but against a foe who understands this area a teeny bit better. Erica Leerhsen(the wiccan in BLAIR WITCH 2 and victim of Leatherface in the 1998 remake of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE) gets the lead finally in a horror film as a suicidal victim of a hard relationship and the new horror hottie right now Crystal Lowe  as a slutty model who plans to help boost ratings by adding spice to the show. Ken Kirzinger(Jason Voorhies of FREDDY VS JASON)has the role of head mutant who swings a mean axe and is a dead aim with a cross-bow.",5.0,4619
mazu_, Dreadful.,Anyone in their right mind cannot find this movie to be as good as most of the comments here say it is. After reading the comments on the first page I decided to give this movie a chance. Oh did I regret that or what! It would be nice if all the marketing teams would stop trying to promote their movies this way it really makes it harder to know which movies are worth seeing...The acting is dumb the dialogs makes your head twitch and the storyline is messed up. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the gory scenes actually look quite real. Except for the fingers.Anyway Id give this 3/10 but since everyone else are hyping this nonsense video up - Im forced to say 1/10.,1.0,4620

kannibalcorpsegrinder, Immensely enjoyable and entertaining slasher,While out in the Virginia woods a group filming the pilot for a survivalist reality TV show run across a group of deformed inbred cannibals intent on killing and eating them all forcing them into a real-life race for survival against the vicious killers to get out of the woods alive.This was an awesome brutal hyper-gory and entertaining slasher effort that was much more enjoyable than expected and wasnt at all expected. One of the best elements here with this one is the outline of the proposed reality show theyre attempting to film is quite fun and original and wouldve been quite a hit. The apocalyptic scenario is worn through really well here and since theyre given quite a lengthy introduction which makes for a solid layout and gives this a really enjoyable setup to lead into the action once they get going into the woods. The opening roadside ambush on the detour trail the first encounters with the crew being seen over the games video monitors and the great attack on the host along the treeline before getting abducted by the group get this going nicely along into some great chase scenes here. Theres the chilling escape from their house where after watching them give birth on the table they have to run off into the woods which leads to some great chasing a truly enjoyable ambush down by the river where a bikini-clad contestant is alerted to their presence by the blaring game contraptions and causing them to come roaring out of the jungle hacking away with the knife leading to a gruesome bloody kill and the rather fun and thrilling scene where the host escapes and battles with the lone member left at the campground which features some solid action throughout as well as getting to up the brutality angle. That brutality angle is furthered in the final half where theyre finally aware that somethings going on in the woods around them the last set of traps in the forest as they get hunted rather viciously and setting the stage for the great finale in the abandoned plant. The setting is great but once the family arrives theres plenty to like as the non-stop tormenting of the family forcing them into rather brutal attacks to stop them gives this some really over-the-top moments that gives this a lot to really like. Alongside the graphic and brutal gory kills theres also a lot to really like here with the family as their demented nature gruesome looks and hilarious social structure makes for some intimidating and imposing villains. These here give this a lot to really like except for one sequence here most will spot easily. This is the lame and protracted dinner sequence in the finale which is a shot-for-shot lift of such a classic scene from another horror effort and even manages to crib the same mannerisms and mocking tone while doing so an activity that flies in the Face of their established behavior only to showcase this homage which lowers it significantly. An early kill scene featured here is also worth mentioning for the CGI needed to showcase it is so distracting that theres nothing about it that works. Beyond that theres nothing really wrong with this one.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.,9.0,4622
davidhall81, Decent Friday night entertainment,First off were talking about a slasher film here so any discussion of originality is irrelevant. For its genre this is a decent enough film.The cast of characters ticks all the requisite boxes. Weve got the lovable wise-cracking joker weve got the slut who provides the nubile young flesh on tap weve got the cold and beautiful blonde with the troubled past weve got the jock (whos also the token black guy thus ticking 2 boxes in the demographic charts) and finally weve got the impossibly gorgeous lesbian (whos also the token Hispanic thus again killing 2 birds with one stone). This kind of stuff must take all of 15 seconds to pitch to a studio before they start writing the blank cheques. All the same its a formula that works so why mess with it? Theres plenty of blood and gore for those keen on it (myself being one) and there are breasts bikinis deformed babies some racy mutant sex you name it. Some questionable effects it has to be said (the intestines - of which there are many - look like bright red balloon animals) but those are minor quibbles. This is a film which despite being so gruesome in places is supposed to be good late-night fun to be enjoyed with a pizza a few beers and your mates. It probably drives aspiring film-makers - sweating their souls out onto the page to try to get their intensely personal visions made - insane that stuff like this gets made but hey its popular and has no pretensions to be a work of art.To sum up its good fun. Youll find more original things between the pages of a Mills and Boon romance novel for sure but not so much bare flesh and splattering blood. Needless to say the ending is nicely set up for the inevitable 3rd part (these mutants seem pretty much indestructible) and I for one will rent it when it comes out crack open a beer invite a few friends round and enjoy the sillier side of life :),8.0,4623
magic-tone, Solid Outing For The Hungry Hillbillies,Let me start with all the negative points this excellent film has possessed in.First of all story-lines in horror films are important for me. It makes the mood more creepý and rational. Wrong Turn 2 had a story line but- i felt they needed to add a bit more of it into it. Perhaps add a scene when they captured their first human and when they began to have a taste for human flesh. But they captured the story-line quite well. 7/10The deformed families acted a bit strange in some is really young he acts like he hasnt killed before he has a sister. It seems that there were too many at the same time in different scenes. The girl cannibal who killed Elena acted like she was the husband of the boy cannibal masturbating about Elena. And then later on they have sex only to realise they are siblings because towards the end of the film the dad and the mum cannibal seem to be the parents of the boy and girl cannibal. And when the brother kills Jonesy and Amber things start to get crazy. He masturbates he has a sister. Whom he has sex with! If this is really what the Producers meant to be this is one screwed up family. 5/10. (Couldnt have tried to add more deformed people could they?)Last but not least the story-line of Michael cheating on Mara. I hated how the movie completely forgets about it. All of a sudden Nina Michael and Elena dont even care about it. Especially Nina i would have expected her to yell at Michael or at least look for him or something. I think Mara was killed off too early with the axe to the head. Mara should have gone down to Michael and Elena during Michaels Afternoon Delight. Terrible just terrible they needed to add some romance to the characters and some conflicts between the cheating of Mara caused by Michael. 3/10Now lets finish with the positive points about Wrong Turn 2.I loved it how the movie was based on a reality TV show. Not like a cliché: when a group of friends go on a drive car breaks down goes to look for help finds out they are being hunted and down and killed one by one. Nonono. Wrong Turn 2 developed a much better story than that. It got you into the movie cause it was exciting and it got you wondering what would happen during the game with the cannibals hunting all of them down. 8/10My favourite were the deaths in Wrong Turn 2. (Major Spoilers throughout from here) Kimberly: Chopped in half Camera Guy: Throat Slit Mara: Axe to the head Amber And Jonesy: Arrow through each persons eye Elena: Back slashed Dale: Choked to death while losing blood.The deaths were exciting and gory. Including towards the end of the movie when we see the realistic lives of the cannibals. All their food and gore and guts just exploded everywhere. Including their dinner! Yuck! But pretty enjoyable. 10+/10Lastly this movie had a creepy mood to the forest. Every second you think a cannibal will JUMP OUT and slaughter everyone. Its just mad and wonderful. The cannibals adjust and hide really well. They are also scary and creepy as hell! 10/10Overall Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is an excellent horror flick with good advantages and points to it. Well done Producers and Directors you have produced a terrifying and creepy cannibal movie.9/10,9.0,4624
kairingler, inbreeding 2,"at first i thought that the idea of a survivalist ""game show"" based around this movie would be utterly ridiculous i think that Henry Rollins  really made this one work.  Kimberly Caldwell was also pretty good as well. this one involves 6 contestants for a prize of 100000 dollars to the survivor"" of the game.. but little do they know that lurking out in the West Virginia woods are some very pesty inbreeding cannibals and they are hungry and also apparently sexually hungry. now let me say upfront that there is a sex scene involving two inbreeds so if that is offensive FF past that.. there is a very touching moment in the movie when the father lets his boy shoot the bow and arrow and like the two just look at each other in a cool father and son moment. overall i thought that the movie was a blast it was pretty visceral im also glad that Eliza Duzka did not return she was so annoying in the first one. i think this one is pretty close to the original if not slightly better.",9.0,4625
insomniac_rod, Let's keep on ROLLIN'!,"To be honest I had regular-high expectations towards this movie. Recently I re-watched the original ""Wrong Turn"" and I thought it was almost great if it wasnt for ""Hollywoods contribution"" on it. So i decided to buy this sequel (very cheap!) to watch Henry Rollins kicking some serious ass. Were my expectations delivered? You bet! Did Henry Rollins kicked much asses? Yes oh yes!""Wrong Turn 2"" stars with a furious pace and doesnt stops until the glorious-gory ending. The first scene of the movie shows a reality t.v. star traveling to the woods to meet with a production staff in order to start filming a new reality t.v. show called ""Apocalypse.""Soon she is murdered and the fun begins! Retired Lt. Col. Dale Murphy is the host of the show and 6 people will be at his charge. We hve the super extremely hot Elena Lina the bitch attitude hot chick Jonesy the funny guy the athletic guy and the lesbian tough chick. They are joined by production staff such as the producer and his hot girlfriend. Soon one by one they will face blood thirsty cannibals that seem to know perfectly the woods and will hunt them. Dale Murphy will get really really mad and that means serious ass kicking! Except Henry Rollins wearing Rambo clothes and even painting his face. Oh things become beautiful when he gets mano a mano with the mutants. The man steals the show and delivers a great performance.The acting is really good for its standards the direction is very fresh and the gore is simply amazing. When you get an unrated flick in all of its glory nothing can go wrong. Take note Hollywood! This is a better example of how direct to video efforts are even better than ""popular"" and commercial movies. So ""Wrong Turn 2"" had the basic elements in order to get considered as a cult classic DTV effort. I mean it succeeded in all possible ways: 1- Gore 2- Fast pace 3- Likable characters 4- Sexy very sexy women & nudity (thank you Crystal Lowe you got the best body Ive seen recently) 5- Henry Rollins slaughtering some damn inbreds. 6- Fast paced direction and a fantastic fun factor.If you are into DTV Horror or just gory films please dont rent this on buy it. Its one of the most memorable sequels to any horror cult classic.",10.0,4626
danibanez, film comment,film alright however Im sorry to say that the acting is terrible I wont go to much into it because it will spoil the film for ya (let you decide) but in my own personal opinion it aint very well thought off I dont think just like many number 2s (Saws to mention one) never nowhere as good as the first just overdone it on this one. on the good sides of the film the good actors are the inbreds its like any normal family in the world but off course with one almighty difference they are flesh eating psycho nut cases which are obviously on a completely different world to us but the similarities with us for example (father and son bonding as you will see in the film and relationship tiffs.) watch the film i hope you like it but I wouldnt watch it myself.thanks for you time reading my review Dan,5.0,4627
nickilancaster, Only OK.,Having liked Wrong Turn i thought i would go out on a limb and buy Wrong turn 2: Dead End. I dont think its as good as the first in the way of the story or characters but its OK if you like horror films and lots of blood and guts. What it lacks in terms of the plot it makes up in with over the top gruesome killings and the total sickness of the weirdo hillbillies. The story for the film is a good one but i dont think it was done as well as it could have been and most of the characters in the film were rather annoying and i was glad they got killed i.e the ugly skinny excuse for a man who cheated on his girlfriend ha ha glad he got what he deserved lol. If your a fan of lots of blood and lots and lots of killings then this is the film for you. It was OK but i think went just a bit too far with the sickness of it all. 6/10.,6.0,4628
moviewizguy," In the Forest, Only They Can Hear You Scream.","Retired military commander Colonel Dale Murphy hosts the simulated post-apocalyptic reality show where participants are challenged to survive a remote West Virginia wasteland. But the show turns into a nightmarish showdown when each realizes they are being hunted by an inbred family of cannibals determined to make them all dinner!I kinda sorta liked the first movie. It has its shares of pros and cons but ends up being an average horror movie with nothing special in store. I can say the exact same thing for this little sequel. This is what you expect from any other horror movie. Nudity sex gore violence clichés etc so Im going to give this an average rating.Theres nothing new here obviously but the movie sure in some ways is entertaining. In others maybe not. Trust me if you love gore theres a lot of that here but this film manages to be more mean spirited than the first. Yes thats why I feel for the characters. Also I feel for the ""cannibals"". Yes its a disgrace.Anyway this film manages to be better and worse than the first film. This film is more laid back and ""have fun"" type of feel to it. Still the dialog is sometimes very bad and the performances a little outlandish.If youre a fan of the first film you may like this. If youre a gore/violence fan you may like this. If youre a horror fan you may not like this. If youre looking for a fright flick to see at night and forget tomorrow this may be the film for you. Otherwise RENT.",5.0,4629
Kzbd, Henry Rollins Gross out movie,"In place of suspense do you really need to put human entrails in every scene? I thought you were always telling the world how smart you are. Is that what you call creative? I can watch your TV show if I want to puke. Seriously every movie that has Henry Rollins is a long display of gross stuff like close ups of deformed hillbillies having sex people vomiting the aforementioned human entrails etc etc. All this uncreative content is magnified by the camera lingering on all of these disgusting features. Pathetic low budget doesnt have to be low IQ. Again how is that consistent with the constant Henry Rollins ""you people are so stupid"" act? Maybe the rest of the world isnt stupid maybe you just dont get the rest of the world.",1.0,4630
TheMovieDoctorful, Far Too Good For Its Franchise,"If ever there was a film that had no right being as good as it was its Wrong Turn 2. A sequel to an unwatchably bad 2000s slasher that soars in every way that its predecessor sinks. Not only that it completely redeems and fully realized the botched premise of another terrible slasher film Halloween: Resurrection. The films blend of found footage reality TV with over-the-top slasher gore is funny creepy and genuinely unpredictable. And its a sequel to Wrong Turn of all things!The performances are a great deal of fun all around. Erica Leerhsen is great actress whos unfortunately been saddled with mostly terrible movies (Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 03 e.t.c) that she usually ends up being the best part of. Here she more than proves herself as a phenomenal lead actress and one of the best anti-final girls Ive ever seen. Her Nina is relatable ferocious and surprisingly complex for a slasher lead and Leerhsen brings a great combination of grit and vulnerability to the role. This is the character that an actress of her caliber always deserved but never got previously.Speaking of Texas Battle (best known for Final Destination 3 and Dragonball: Evolution...Yeah) also proves himself a better actor than his filmography would indicate. He manages to give a lot of likability and depth to a character that easily could have just been a jock stereotype. Instead hes written as acted to be invested in and comes across as a very selfless honorable and likable hero. Im surprised his Jake isnt brought up more often as an example of progressive black representation in Horror films.Ken Kirzinger best known for playing Jason Voorhees in Freddy vs. Jason proves himself as far more than just a body behind a hockey mask as Pa. He carries such a creepy foreboding menace and dead stone coldness in his eyes that few monster actors can really nail. He kills and eviscerates with a real purpose and genuinely becomes his villainous character. More unexpectedly I really bought the love and affection that he held for his family in his body and facial acting. I can see why he was cast in Freddy vs. Jason ad a more human take on his character as he brings that same mild humanity here. Its a shame he gets so much hate merely for replacing Kane Hodder when hes a great actor in his own right you can consider this his Hatchet so to speak.The kills are absolutely phenomenal. Both the backwoods and found footage elements are wonderfully realized in some dispatchings that do a perfect job balancing between Looney Tunes on Meth fun and genuine terror. Theyre the kind of kills that the very best Friday the 13th films capture. Even better its not just the villains that help to contribute to those memorable kills; Henry Rollins Dale Murphy should put a smile on the face of everyone who ever wanted to root for Michael or Jason. In fact his kills may be the most violent and explosive (pun fully intended) of the movie. Even Nina and Jake manage to get in some pretty cathartic bloody violence against their tormentors by the end. Its always nice to see slasher heroes as brutal and relentless as the villains in these kinds of films.The directing by Joe Lynch is so much better than the first film that its hard to believe it belongs to the same franchise. The balance between reality TV and slasher is realized wonderfully and it really embraces what we love about both (the tragic melodramatic backstories of the heroes the hyperbolic violence the memorable one liners the outstanding practical effects the atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife) while ditching what we hate (the predictable survivors the bad acting the awful production values) Wrong Turn 2 is definitive proof that Halloween: Resurrection bad as it was. was onto something when it made the connection between the appeal of the slasher entertainment and millennial obsession with reality TV. It just took a mind like Lynchs to realize it.This is also a great film for people who like their slashers with more twists and turns than a roller coaster. From the unconventional body count (the ""final girl"" archetype is the first one to die) to sharp tonal shifts that genuinely work (the contestants making sex jokes while eating barbecue only to find themselves snacking on a friend) its a film that always had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was coming next.Wrong Turn 2 is one of the biggest surprises Ive ever had watching a Horror film. Its everything I wanted the first movie to be and more. If you were turned off by the first film being little more than a low effort Eliza Dukshu vehicle Id highly recommend checking the sequel out. Its better in every single way.",10.0,4631
jacobjohntaylor1, Good movie.,This is a good movie. Wrong turn is better. But still this movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. 5.5 is a good ratting. But this is such a great movie that 5.5 is underrating it. I give this movie 9 out 10. It is scarier the The silence of the lambs could ever be. This is scarier Then the 2003 remake of the Texas chainsaw massacre could ever be. This is a great horror movie. If you like horror movies that you nee to see this movie. It is scarier then A Nightmare on elm street and that is not easy to do. It is scarier then Friday the 13th V a new beginning and that is not easy to do. Great movie.,9.0,4632
baileygiannini, As a reality TV game show is being filmmed in the woods. Mutant creatures kill the contestants off one by one.,Where to begin? Wrong Turn 2 takes its own wrong turn as being the most terrible movie ever. Trust me. This film is full of disappointments. I have not all seen a sequel do this bad before. Except for one which is Rob Zombies Halloween II. But in real good horror films I have never seen this. Usually its the third film that brings it all down. But surprisingly this one did bring it down really far. And after this one there was no turning back. I have but one question. Why? Can someone whos a film expert because Im just a critic. Please explain to me why this film was made. Because from my point of view it just doesnt make any sense. This might as well have been the same story over again in just a different situation. To me all of The Wrong Turn films are the same. If youve seen the first film youve seen them all.,3.0,4633
Lambysalamby, Diabolical. Worst film ever.,Oh my God where to begin with this one. It actually had a decent concept to begin with but had the worst execution possible. The idea of this one was to have the victims on a survivor type show. This idea could have given a wealth of ideas and concepts but everything was absolutely terrible. I cannot believe there are people here rating the film so highly. Ive seen almost 1600 films and this is probably the worst I have seen out of all of those! (the only film I can think coming close to it is Tusk)It had: TERRIBLE actors TERRIBLE characters. TERRIBLE makeup TERRIBLE dialogue TERRIBLE music TERRIBLE ideas.Its Fn TERRIBLE MURIAL!Overall Opinion: Avoid this like the plague! Oh my good God.,1.0,4634

krycek19," Really dumb, freaking sick, disgusting gory horrorflick",I dont know why people here like this sick really dumb movie. What is wrong with you?? Aside from the really stupid story about contestants in a reality-show being killed off one by one by the mutants its really really sick the acting is horrible and gross overkill in almost every scene.The original Wrong Turn was a good little horror movie. It had a good script good actors likable characters and the mutants was actually scary.In this one the mutants are just ridiculous they can talk which ruins it completely. The most sickening scenes was a mutantwoman giving birth to a mutantbaby mutants making out and having sex. Why do we have to see this?? Is this what the audience demands to be satisfied today?? As for the human characters that were supposed to root for didnt care for any of them. They were all just their to be killed in the most disgusting ways and chopped to pieces and eaten. The Rambo-wannabe character was so unbelievably dumb that I just wish he would die really quickly.How the clearly sick screenwriter ever got this garbage financed is beyond me. But its all about the bottom-line in Hollywood.Unless you got a strong stomach and you get off on watching people being killed and chopped into pieces and eaten nonstop for 90 minutes stay away from this garbage!! I sure wish I had!!,1.0,4636
Coventry, Barrels full of Blood & Gore ... Literally!,"Initially when stumbling upon the news there was going to be a sequel to ""Wrong Turn"" my prompt reaction (and Im sure that of many other avid horror fans as well) was to skip it. Lets face it the 2003 original was good but certainly not great (and actually already quite derivative of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") the sequel received the feared straight-to-DVD treatment and the cast is primarily a gathering of nobodies. Only after reading a bunch of praising reviews around here on this website my curiosity got sparked. People whose opinions I respect and always take into account were referring to ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" as a superior product and literally everybody agreed that the level of blood & gore was much more satisfying. Personally I cant really say its better than the original because its even more clichéd and depthless but theres certainly no argument regarding the gore-factor! The lack of theatrical release at least offered one giant advantage namely there were absolutely no restrictions in the special effects & make-up departments. Not even five minutes into the film and the intestines of a young blond girl (a familiar face for American mainstream TV-viewers) already lay spread out on the streets. After the pleasingly gooey opening comes the overlong and dull but sadly inevitable introduction of the déjà-vu plot and the stereotypical characters. Six greedy & media-horny youngsters participate in the brand new (?) reality-TV show called Ultimate Survivor: The Apocalypse. Former military commander & beefcake host Dale Murphy explains how theyll have to spend five days within the isolated & nearly impenetrable woods of West Virginia with assignments along the way and no food reserves. Of course no ones aware these woods are the natural habitat of an inbred family of deformed cannibals. These bloodthirsty and relentless freaks welcome the visitors with open arms and use all their primitive weapons and booby traps to get fresh human meat on the food table. ""Wrong Turn 2"" offers nothing new or special except a wide & amusing variety of supremely mean-spirited killings ugliness and perversity. Some of the gory highlights include the birth of a 3rd generation inbred baby two kills with one arrow body explosions an axe in the head and a vicious throat slitting. The absolute cutest toy is a still functioning meat grinder in the cannibals house and all the victims that go through there end up in barrels full of blood pus and intestines. Yummy! Theres zilch suspense (or what else did you expect?) at the beginning you can immediately appoint which characters will die and in what order the performances are lamentable and you can count the number of competently written dialogs on the fingers of one hand. ""Wrong Turn 2"" is fun undemanding but also forgettable horror entertainment nothing more & nothing less.",5.0,4637

markovd111," Dumb, but self aware and fun!",Basically if you like slashers you will like this movie! It has a decent cast of cheesy characters you will get to love pretty soon and you will feel a little sad when they start dying. Well for some of them anyway... My only bigger complaints are that the movie is sometimes too gross just for the sake of it and that there is practically nothing to really be scared of. But all that doesnt matter because this thing is just a great piece of fun for any slasher fan out there. Oh and it has one of the greatest hero characters of all time featured in a slasher along with Ash Williams! I give it a 6.5/10 and I recommend it to all my fellow horror movie fans not for the scares but for fun. The rest can avoid it as I doubt they can find something to love here.,6.0,4640

SyoKennex, Could have been better; but still a good survival horror,Note: Spoilers below for Wrong Turn (2003)Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is the second film in the Wrong Turn series and this time a reality show is being filmed in the forest where the inbred hillbilly family stalk the trees looking for their next meal. Survival horror once again following the success of Wrong Turn and released in 2007 four years after release. After watching the first Wrong Turn film I decided that I wanted to watch more of the series and see how it played out. There didnt seem to be much to lead off within the ending of the first film with the main villains all being killed off by Chris; there was hardly anything for Joe Lynch to direct the second film on.However he managed to come up with a generic plot line much like the first but with a different generic subplot. I actually quite enjoyed this whereas many people that were fans of the first Wrong Turn film didnt. The plot of the reality television show was really enjoyable and I found that I really liked it. A lot of the characters are strong; not as strong as Jessie and Chris in the first film but strong none the less.There were a few things that really turned me off about this film and that was the crude remarks towards the lesbian character – I believe Amber; its been a while since I saw the film – and I found these to make me frown quite deeply and zone out of the film for a few minutes at a time. However the development that Jonesy had throughout the film did make me smile. He began to become a character that I thought quite highly off especially when the end of his story came. Nina had a lot of character development as well and it truly warmed my heart to see how well she became a much stronger character and someone that the team could rely on even with how panicked she was. Jake as well was a really strong character and I loved him and Mara was a wonderful character. There were a lot of times where I found myself with a smile on my face and a lot of these characters felt so real. There wasnt a single character that I didnt feel like I could bump into them in the real world and it takes a lot of good acting for so many characters in a single film – especially just another horror film – to feel so real to the viewers.The plot line however was pretty generic and the same as the previous film. Run through the forest try and survive the cannibalistic murderers dont get caught. There wasnt much substance to it and that was a bit of a shame. I had hoped that Lynch would try and make the film a little more original than just being a basic carbon copy of the first film with a new plot but unfortunately that hasnt happened.Considering the film was shot in only twenty five days there could have been some more added to this. Although a very good film especially for survival horror I felt that there was quite a bit lacking. More could have been added for sure to thicken the plot a little and maybe even background as to how some of the cannibals escaped death at the end of the first film. Still a good film just not as good as it could have been.,7.0,4645
Leofwine_draca, Extraordinarily grisly sequel,Its been a few years since I saw the original WRONG TURN and its a film I dont remember much about: it was okay middling in fact entertaining in places and completely derivative. Its sequel is a different beast entirely as the filmmakers do away with any attempts at menace in favour of making an all-out gore fest. Indeed WRONG TURN 2 is one of the goriest movies Ive seen in recent years a film packed full of brutal and grotesque deaths all brought to life by the latest extreme special effects. From the opening kill in which a woman is split in half with an axe you know exactly what youre in for with this one.I admit to a certain fondness for these psychos-in-the-woods type films even if the genre has been definitely overpopulated in recent years (SHROOMS SEVERANCE WILDERNESS MANHUNT EDEN LAKE and in particular BACKWOODS which copies this film no end). The scripts are never up to much but I love woodland scenery and its easy to direct decent chase scenes when your characters are running through the trees or hiding out in the bushes. Here the villains are a group of mutant redneck types and the main characters are involved in some kind of reality TV series which quickly turns deadly. The characters are a mix of jocks and bimbos all of them clichéd in the extreme although kudos to the scriptwriter for not killing off the black guy first like in most of these. The only person of interest is Henry Rollins as the tough instructor who becomes a Rambo-like hero figure in the second half.All of the female cast members are good looking and the producers convince one starlet to strip off midway through for a lakeside sex scene but for the most part the emphasis is on the gore and you end up waiting for the next death. People are shot with arrows get axes through their heads are slashed with machetes and a meat grinder is involved in the final few scenes so expect blood and entrails to be liberally sprayed around. It may not be high art but this straight-to-video effort knows what it is: a gory sometimes fun B-movie that manages to entertain despite the many flaws.,6.0,4646

roastedpeanuts-110-333323, Overall a great film,The storyline of the film is where they have a survival game show to be screened in America where people double up and have to survive without food and water and have to use teamwork to survive there are also many challenges along the way. The one thing they did not know is the woods area where they were playing the game show in had mutated cannibalised humans who basically have lived there many years feeding of of humans who have got lost there or simply being attacked while on their travels.Wrong turn 2 has a bit of a twist and more entertainment to it then wrong turn did especially towards the end you also see a lot more scenes of the mutated cannibals in this film as you did in wrong turn.The only problem with this film is that it does not have any heart stopping moments in it like there was in the first one for example when they were getting chased through the dark and hid in the watch tower in wrong turn 1But overall a good film liked it equally as much as the 1st one. If you like the 1st one you will like this without a doubt.I recommend this film and it is also not even scary so dont be put off watching it.8/10 Rated,9.0,4648
bloodbeast-786-771289, very good fun to watch.,first let me get this out of the way by saying this is by far a good movie. what this movie does achieve is some good old fashioned campy fun. i think the best part of this move is henry rollins as the ex- marine corp commander now in charge of the reality show that these people are on. then lo and behold here come inbred cannibal hillbillies and as the kids scramble and run in fear henry rollins marine corp training kicks in after he is captured bu the cannibals. i wont spoil more of the movie you must watch it yourself but overall it has good special effects and looks like it actually had a decent budget for a straight to DVD release (if it was in theaters i didnt know im just assuming it was direct release) so again if you want a good movie dont watch this but if you want a fun gore filled action ove this is the perfect movie.,8.0,4649
tequila101," Fun, Gory and Messed Up Once Again",After watching the first Wrong Turn ages ago and seeing that two sequels were out I had no high hopes and thought that the sequel would crash and burn but I was way way ahead of myself. As described up at the top (my summary) this film appears as a very fun gory and very messed up sequel which works. Im going to get to the excellent points about what makes this sequel fun to watch.The director actually gives us a decent story which we can watch and work out. He also gives us enough creepy scenes for where we can be creeped out sometimes.The director gave us some good kills and I actually enjoyed all of these kills and none of them were crappy at all. The actions sequences and chases sequences were also executed well and that made the film bump up to its right potential.The one little problem I had though was the cannibals who didnt look as effective or as real as the ones in the first film. They were cool and it was excellent how they started up a family and they brought Three Finger back but they just werent real enough to say that it was at least scary.Another thing was the director said that he added humor but I found none.But overall the story is stable enough and good enough the music score is decent the characters are likable and the sequences of each scene was done (not as good as the original) but still good enough my liking.This sequel deserves to be watched straight after the first (something I didnt do lol). 7.7/10,8.0,4650
happyendingrocks," If Peter Jackson was still making horror movies, they might look a lot like Wrong Turn 2","The second installment in the Wrong Turn franchise pares down the pure horror elements that made the original such an effective thriller in favor of considerably amping up the gore and the body count. While not quite as strong as the first outing this entertaining sequel boasts some wonderfully demented moments and it is most assuredly a worthy successor.Here the cannibalistic clan from the first movie is revealed to be an extended family and their menu is the cast and crew of a ""Survivor""-style reality show being filmed in their backwoods stomping grounds. The set-up is actually very well done and the none-too-subtle satire of reality TV is on the mark and largely pretty humorous.Henry Rollins is clearly having a ball hamming it up as the programs host a macho ex-Marine with a penchant for glaring at the camera and grunting survivalist catch-phrases. Later in the film when he is forced to get dirty and combat the murderous family he proves to be a fine action hero and his performance is solid enough to make us forgive him for the awful music of the Rollins Band.The rest of the cast is also mostly strong and the film-makers of this sequel apparently noted that us caring what happened the characters in the original made the gruesome fates that befell them have more impact. The biggest exception to this mindset is Steve Brauns Jonesy who is obviously positioned to provide the requisite comic relief but instead proves to be one of the most annoying and unfunny characters ever seen in a horror movie. Though we know from the first time we see him that hes going to be part of the cannibal clans smörgåsbord guessing who among the rest of the cast will make it to the final reel doesnt prove to be nearly as easy. At least one character who seems poised to survive the ordeal makes a shockingly early exit via a hatchet to the head and Dead End earns big points for tossing in surprises like this along the way.The afore-mentioned blood-letting is doled out generously and most of the kills in this film are absolute gore-fests. Fans of the red sauce certainly wont be disappointed and the chain of niftily nauseating murders ensures that Dead End stands out as a top-notch splatter offering. There are also some truly inspired moments of grand guignol lunacy my favorite being a scene in which one of the young killers stands beneath two hanging corpses and gleefully laps at the blood dribbling from their swaying bodies like a child catching snowflakes on their tongue.While the original Wrong Turn repeatedly referenced the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise Dead End unabashedly lifts both a key scene and a key plot point. Its impossible to watch Erica Leerhsens ""dinner"" scene without recalling Marilyn Burns sitting at the head of the Sawyers table and even her dialogue is almost identical. Likewise the abandoned paper mill in this film is a functional doppelganger for the abandoned amusement park in Chainsaw Part 2. However despite the derivative nature of some of these elements Dead End has a spirit all its own and since we can easily chalk these similarities up as homages they dont distract from the effective and original twists this film brings to the table (Im not sure if that pun was intended or not).One of the most intriguing aspects of the film is how thoroughly the cannibal family is fleshed out as characters instead of mere antagonists. In the original the killers were simply archetypical monstrous stalking maniacs but this time out the film delves into the nuances of their familial life. We see their conflicts their rituals their grotesquely affectionate interactions and we even see them bump uglies (literally Im guessing). This depth actually serves to make their culinary activities more horrifying since the sadistic and inhuman handiwork they dish out is presented as part of their otherwise ""normal"" domestic dynamic.Dead End does have one glaring logic problem: if the merciless killers butcher anyone who comes into their woods how did the producers of the reality show manage to install cameras and props all over the familys habitat and come out unscathed? If you dont think about this too hard its fairly easy to overlook and since the main reason to watch this film has nothing to do with overt realism this plot-hole doesnt ultimately sink the movie.The final scene promises more Wrong Turns to come and considering how close this sequel comes to matching the enjoyability of the original Im not opposed to taking a few more trips into the woods. For now this bloody treat offers enough to chew on for a while. Dead End is a hell of a lot of fun and highly recommended.",8.0,4651
howellgirl2011, A family has come to make a meal out of actors and actresses on a game show recording.,The film was good especially the fact that there is a whole family that is having babies and hunting down innocent people for food. I was quite terrified when the two kids were chasing everyone and enjoying killing everyone in their sight. I was like are you kids crazy dont you enjoying taking innocent lives and surviving to eat what you captured to devour? I really thought this was a great film. But I thought it was even more twisted than the first film. I was scared when a video had shown this guy being decapitated right in front of the camera and then the head falls right in front of the lens. I was like run dude run run like your life depended on it dont turn back just run like the wind dont stop just run to the road and get help! When that scene was shown when the cannibal woman is giving birth I nearly threw up because I must admit that was gross and sick to watch. But when the dead girl was shown on the hood of their truck I was like shes no deer put her on the back of the truck not the front thats disgusting! I suggest not let anyone under 13 or younger watch this film because they will get sick or not sleep for days. I hope there is a sequel to this!,8.0,4652
Boba_Fett1138," Bad, formulaic first half gets saved by much better second half.","The movie started off promising alright but it then turned very fast into something much worse. The movie became a lame and cheap looking horror flick that picked an uninteresting and also unlikely approach. It just didnt worked out as an horror at all. But luckily the movie its second half was something much better when the original approach of the movie gets totally abandoned and gets replaced by something simpler but far more effective and enjoyable.Basically the movie is still being like a lot of other genre movies but I still like and appreciate this movie for trying something original as well. At times it works out but at others it also really doesnt. It makes this a bit of an uneven movie also considering that the movie its first half is quite weak while its second one is simply good and maybe even a little bit more than that. It doesnt always make this movie a very good or effective horror movie to watch but luckily the movie is still being entertaining throughout.Everything about this movie basically screams cheap and it obviously got shot in an hurry. Its a movie that can get quite lame due to its tiresome approach at times silly weak characters and a simplistic story. But oh well not every movie can be made with a big budget and can have a large crew and extensive production time. In all honesty if you have to make a good cheap genre movie in just a couple of weeks time ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End"" is a good example on how to do it. Considering all of its factors and the fact that this is a sequel as well this is simple a more than good movie.Just dont give up on this movie once you are starting to get annoyed and/or disappointed by the movie its first half the movie soon turns into something much better that will also please the genre fans for sure (yes there also is plenty of gore to enjoy). I actually enjoyed this movie much more than the first one and in the long run its a far more original one as well.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,4653
dusan-22, Good idea but very poor execution.,This film could have been a nice horror movie if the director had developed the movie plot more carefully and applied better casting as the movie plot idea is not bad at all. Like this the movie looks like childish cinema one project created on some film college. For example very important character - the commando guy looks more like some comedian so at the beginning I was not sure if this is some Steve Martin movie or a horror. Besides pretty bad acting of some characters is irritating. Once again instead of intelligent action director tends to use bizarre scenes to draw our attention. By that he also uncovers many mystic moments that he could use to create tension and fear more effectively then by using kilotons of blood with and without purpose. From my point of view this is the worse part of the movie trilogy Wrong Turn.,2.0,4654
rajon07, This is the Justice League movie we deserve,As a life long comic fan DC characters are more close to my heart than Marvel characters. The first making of this film was just disappointing. It seems like there are bunch of idiots sitting on the WB executive positions who have no vision at all. The first film was literally incomplete. This one tells the full story and I must say nicely. This is the movie we all the fans wanted and deserve.,9.0,4655
eloybeugelink, Superheroes Unite!,"Yesss thank you Zack Snyder!THIS is the movie the DC heroes deserved...And the fans as well!Its an amazing continuation on ""Man Of Steel"" and ""Batman V Superman"" and the story is splendid this way.

deeformecreep, It leaves you asking for more!,Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize.Honestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film.,10.0,4658
jasmeetgaba77, The superhero collaboration movie should be atleast 3 hours long,The longer they are the more time they get to set up the story The pace is perfect The stories of each character is perfectly timed Nothing feels rushed and the dark theme just ups the game Justice has finally been done to the reputation of justice league,9.0,4659
aminussh," Incredible, far better than previous cut",Zack snyders justice league is far better than theatrical cut in every way you can think of steppenwolf is an actual threat now his cgi is great he has a clear goal but cyborg is the heart of the movie and one of the best characters Snyder did each hero justice and flash powers are incredible and mind-blowing Wonder woman is nothing like what weve seen in ww84 she is a valiant warrior and badass character I really liked how they portrayed darkseid and paved the way for a potential JL2 he is an absolute great villain and junkie xl music is really epic and great overall 9/10 for this movie I just had one problem with it: too much slow-motionsNOW its time to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE,9.0,4660
delpierokavinda, Great art,"The story of ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman vs. Superman"" is continued in this movie in such an epic way. This is totally different than the theatrical version. The visual storyline and cinematography is so unique and its perfect. Character buildup plot humor climax emotions in the movie is so great. Its a sight for sore eyes.",10.0,4661
amzadhossain-67539, Awesome movie.,I loved the movie from the beggining to the end.Just like Ray fisher saidI was hoping that the movie doesnt end. The begging scene was mind blowing liked that scene very much. Unlike the Justice League the movie show every hero is best at their own thing make us love every charecters.Thanks Zack and the whole team.,10.0,4662

theghostwhowalks-39050," Beautiful, bold, and grand. This is Cinema.",First of all. This does NOT feel like a 4 hour film. With a busy schedule I had planned to watch it in the parts its divided into. HOWEVER once starting the movie...I was simply LOCKED IN. ZSJL is BRILLIANT. The pacing of the film is masterful the time FLIES by the story MOVES...but it allows for marination of what you are witnessing.The plot is simple and straightforward but complex and beautiful at the same time. Each character has room to breathe and is developed PROPERLY. The dialogue is crisp and important and its clear that Zack Snyder is world building...ESPECIALLY with the crazy twists and the insane ending this movie has. The 3rd act of this film is absolutely grand.Without giving anything away Ray Fishers performance as Cyborg is absolutely incredible. Each characters performance is masterful. Snyder has re-established this team of Gods among people as what the Justice League should have always been...ICONIC AND MYTHIC. The movie feels like (for those of you familiar with comics) an Alex Ross painting or comic or graphic novel IN MOTION with its unique and beautiful CGI. The CGI itself doesnt seem like its trying to convince you of realism but of beauty and artistry..it wants you to see each shot like a painting!BRING US THE SEQUELS!! I also believe that it is IMPORTANT to give Zack the complete creative control he deserves for these sequels. Especially without the constraints of run time. 4 hours. 5 hours. It doesnt matter. Im here for it..WE THE AUDIENCE are here for it. This movie has its place amongst some of the old lengthy mythic films before it like The 10 commandments or Ben-Hur. The fans who fought for this vision of Zack Snyder should be very proud...very proud indeed. A win for artistic integrity.This is more than a comic book film...its riveting its maddening its methodical maniacal its beautiful...as they say: THIS IS CINEMA.This...is Zack Snyders Justice League.,10.0,4664

alshaherahmad, One of the greatest comic book movies ever !,The Snyder cut gave us an explanation to the story and to why is steppenwolf gathering the mother boxes and cyborg backstory and these two thing are the most important stuffs that the original cut missed and whats even better that they removed all the silly jokes that was in the original moviePositives:Every character took his right(main characters)  a better Batman a more powerful steppenwolf with a purpose the cgi has been improved and so much better than the original one  the soundtrack was amazing especially the wonder women one and the most positive thing is the fighting action scenesNegatives:Too much slow motionsMy top 5 scenes1-joker and the Batman dialogue2-the flash time travel scene3-steppenwolf vs the Amazons4-darkside vs everyone5-cyborg see the nightmare visionThank you Snyder !#restorethesnyderverse.,9.0,4668
cjosty, RESTORE THE SNYDER VERSE,Zack Snyders Justice League is an EPIC in every sense of the word. From its incredible set peices to its expertly crafted story telling this is the best film yet to come out of the DCEU (even though its said not to be cannon) Its a complete satisfying package that leaves some interesting story threads. Im hoping we now get Zacks JL2 and JL3 in the future. Because one things for sure now more than ever we will all be fighting for WB to Restore The Snyder Verse! Thank you Zack Snyder for showing us your amazing vision.,10.0,4669
asishnpatel, My point of view as an 20 years old from Nepal,After following up varieties of movies from DC i started viewing the positive aspects of live and how one should never let any negativity damage our positivity.

It reaards for ua goodness in this world. Keep smiling keep loving. Hate js useless.,9.0,4670
Pyro_Pizza," Long, but worth it.",Zack Snyders Justice league is an excellent movie. It is however 4 hours long. And I never got bored watching any of it. Its a masterpiece and testament to Synders vision for his movie that we should have gotten to see back in 2017. He fixed the problems with Justice League (2017) and improved upon them must watch for any comic book fan.,8.0,4671

rtbradford, Much Better Movie,This version is so much better than the originally released movie. At first I didnt understand what all the excitement and hype were about when it was announced that the Snyder version was being released but now I understand. The originally released movie was pretty awful. The storyline was disjointed and the character development was almost nonexistent. The Snyder version provided us with full storylines and character development for Cyborg and The Flash as well as eliminating some extraneous material that didnt add to the movie. If you like DC comics and were disappointed with the 2017 version of Justice League go and see this version. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the original.,8.0,4673

mmuradali-65680, The best DC movie till date,Overall Opinion-Although the competitors Marvel have a well organised way of strategic movie releases and have excelled till date.This DC movie is just marvellous that even a neutral comic book audience can enjoy and also the characters in this movie are thoroughly portrayed their personalities and their motives are clear unlike the predecessor of this movie making it a perfect version of a movie.Review-The movie has a strong sense of the impact created from the previous movie and also how the world revolves around the impact is clearly shown very early itself.The pacing of the movie is excellent so much so that it doesnt seem like a 4 hour movie.If Marvel fans want to compare pacing lets just say being a neutral comic book fan myself the pacing can be compared to The Winter Soldier which is one the best movies too.Each characters motives including the antagonist are clearly portrayed and the story telling is so compelling that u feel for those characters.CGI is great in many scenes but only in some scenes are where u can have a lacking sense but overall it was good.This movie actually feels like a compelling story of a comic book rather than its predecessor which felt like a popcorn movie.It had a great beginning and a end where u want more of it and the character development was excellent throughout.A Great movie for the fans who waited for years and a good compelling story driven movie for the neutral comic book audience .,10.0,4678
