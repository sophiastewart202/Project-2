      "        Vaccinated with vial that might have had a temperature excursion; Vaccinated with vial that might have had a temperature excursion; Vaccinated with vial that might have had a temperature excursion; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning a patient who received Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and was vaccinated with vial that might have had a temperature excursion.  The patient's medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 22 Dec 2020, the nurse reported a shipment was received. The vial arrived frozen and was placed in a freezer at recommended temperature.   On 02 Jan 2021, the freezer had failed, and the temperature alarm system did not alert anyone. It was noted that the freezer temperature at 5:50 AM was -5 degrees Celsius (C), at 7:50 AM the freezer was a 1.5 C. It remained between from 9.7 C at 12:51 PM then went to 8.3 C at 1:51 PM then down to -8.7 C at 2:51 PM.  On 03 Jan 2021 8:45 PM, the freezer returned to its normal temperature of -20.9 C, -1 C then went to 5.5 C at 11:56 PM.  On 04 Jan 2021, the temperature climbed to 19.4 C. On the same day, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20-2A, 025L20A, or 027L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection and experienced vaccination with vial that might have had a temperature excursion  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, vaccinated with vial that might have had a temperature excursion, was considered resolved on 04 Jan 2021.; Reporter's Comments: This report refers to a case of out of specification product use, product temperature excursion issue, and product storage error for mRNA-1273. There were no reported AEs associated with this case.     0.06%\n",
